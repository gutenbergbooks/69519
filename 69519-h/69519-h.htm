<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c007'>As the directions which follow were intended for the
conduct of the families of the authoress’s own daughters,
and for the arrangement of their table, so as to unite a
good figure with proper economy, she has avoided all
excessive luxury, such as essence of ham, and that
wasteful expenditure of large quantities of meat for
gravy, which so greatly contributes to keep up the price,
and is no less injurious to those who eat, than to those
whose penury bids them abstain. Many receipts are
given for things which, being in daily use, the mode of
preparing them may be supposed too well known to
require a place in a cookery book; yet how rarely do we
meet with fine melted butter, good toast and water, or
well made coffee! She makes no apology for minuteness
in some articles, or for leaving others unnamed, because
she writes not for professed cooks. This little work
would have been a treasure to herself, when she first set
out in life, and she therefore hopes it may be useful to
others. In that idea it is given to the public, and as she
will receive from it no emolument, so she trusts it will
escape without censure.</p>

  <h2 class='c006'><span class='fixed'>Miscellaneous Observations</span><br> <span class='small'>FOR THE USE OF</span><br> THE MISTRESS OF A FAMILY;<br> <span class='small'>BY WHICH MUCH MONEY WILL BE SAVED, AND THE GENERAL APPEARANCE GREATLY IMPROVED.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c007'>The mistress of a family should always remember
that the welfare and good management of the
house depend on the eye of the superior; and consequently
that nothing is too trifling for her notice,
whereby waste may be avoided; and this attention is
of more importance, now that the price of every necessary
of life is increased to an enormous degree.</p>

<p class='c010'>If a lady has never been accustomed, while single,
to think of family management, let her not upon
that account fear that she cannot attain it; she may
consult others who are more experienced, and acquaint
herself with the necessary quantities of the
several articles of family expenditure in proportion
to the number it consists of.</p>

<p class='c010'>A minute account of the annual income, and the
times of payment, should be taken in writing; likewise
an estimate of the supposed amount of each
<span class='pageno' id='Page_ii'>ii</span>article of expense; and those who are early accustomed
to calculations on domestic articles, will acquire
so accurate a knowledge of what their establishment
requires, as will give them the happy
medium between prodigality and parsimony, without
acquiring the character of meanness.</p>

<p class='c010'>Ready money should be paid for all such things as
come not into weekly bills; and the best places for
purchasing be attended to. In some articles a discount
of five per cent. is allowed in London, and
other large cities; and those who thus pay are usually
best served. Under the idea of buying cheap, many
people go to new shops; but it is safest to deal with
people of established credit, who do not dispose of
bad goods by underselling.</p>

<p class='c010'>To make people wait for their money injures them
greatly, besides that a higher price must be charged:
perhaps the irregularity of payment may have
much evil influence on the price of various articles,
and contribute to the destruction of many families,
in gradation downwards.</p>

<p class='c010'>It is very necessary for a woman to be informed
of the prices and goodness of all articles in common
use, and of the best times, as well as places, for purchasing
them. She should also be acquainted with
the <i>comparative</i> prices of provisions, in order that
she may be able to substitute those that are most
reasonable, when they will answer as well, for others
of the same kind, but which are more costly. A false
notion of economy leads many to purchase as bargains
<span class='pageno' id='Page_iii'>iii</span>what is not wanted, and sometimes never is
used. Were this error avoided, more money would
remain for other purposes. Some things are better
for keeping, and, being in constant consumption,
should be laid in accordingly; such as paper, soap,
and candles. Of these more hereafter.</p>

<p class='c010'>A proper quantity of household articles should
be always ready, and more bought in before the
others be consumed, to prevent inconvenience,
especially in the country.</p>

<p class='c010'>A bill of parcels and receipts should be required,
even if the money be paid at the time of purchase;
and, to avoid mistakes, let the goods be compared
with these when brought home.</p>

<p class='c010'>Though it is very disagreeable to suspect any
one’s honesty, and perhaps mistakes have been unintentional,
yet it is prudent to weigh meat, sugars,
&#38;c. when brought in, and compare with the charge.
The butcher should be ordered to send the weight
with the meat, and the cook to file these checks,
to be examined when the weekly bill shall be delivered.</p>

<p class='c010'>A ticket should be given by the cook for each loaf,
which will on return give the number to be paid for.</p>

<p class='c010'>Thus regularly conducted, the exact state of
money affairs will be known with ease; for it is
delay of payment that occasions confusion.</p>

<p class='c010'>Accounts should be regularly kept, and not the
smallest articles omitted to be entered; and if
balanced every week and month, the income and
outgoings will be ascertained with facility, and their
proportions to other be duly observed. Some people
<span class='pageno' id='Page_iv'>iv</span>approve of keeping in separate purses the
money for different purposes, as domestic articles,
clothes, pocket, education of children, &#38;c.</p>

<p class='c010'>Whichever way accounts be kept, some certain
method should be adopted and strictly adhered
to.</p>

<p class='c010'>Many families have owed their prosperity full
as much to the conduct and propriety of female
management, as to the knowledge and activity of
the father.</p>

<p class='c010'>Those who are served with brewer’s beer, or
any other thing not paid for on delivery, should
have a book for entering the date; which will not
only prevent overcharges, but at one view give the
annual consumption.</p>

<p class='c010'>It is much to be feared, that for the waste of
many of the good things that God has given for
our use, not abuse, the mistress and servants of
great houses will hereafter be called to a strict account.</p>

<p class='c010'>Some part of every person’s fortune should be
devoted to charity; by which “a pious woman will
build up her house before God, while she that is
foolish (<i>i. e.</i> lends nothing to the Lord) pulls it
down with her hands.” No one can complain of the
want of gifts to the poor in this land; but there is
a mode of relief which would add greatly to their
comfort, and which being prepared from superfluity,
and such materials as are often thrown away,
the expense would not be felt. In the latter part
of this work some hints for preparing the above
are given.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_v'>v</span>By good hours, especially early breakfast, a family
is more regular, and much time is saved. If
orders be given soon in the morning, there will be
more time to execute them; and servants, by
doing their work with ease, will be more equal to
it, and fewer will be necessary.</p>

<p class='c010'>It is worthy of notice, that the general expense
will be reduced, if every thing be kept in its proper
place, applied to its proper use, and mended, when
the nature of an accident will allow, as soon as
broken.</p>

<p class='c010'>An inventory of furniture, linen, and china,
should be kept, and the things examined by it
twice a year, or oftener, if there be a change of
servants; into each of whose care the articles used
by him or her, should be intrusted, with a list, as
is done with plate. Tickets of parchment with the
family name, numbered, and specifying what bed
it belongs to, should be sewed on each feather bed,
bolster, pillows, and blankets.</p>

<p class='c010'>Many well meaning servants are ignorant of the
best means of managing, and thereby waste as
much as would maintain a small family, besides
causing the mistress of the house much chagrin
by their irregularity; and many families, from a
want of method, have the appearance of chance
rather than of regular system. To avoid which
the following hints may be useful.</p>

<p class='c010'>All things likely to be wanted should be in
readiness; sugars of different qualities should be
kept broken, currants washed, picked and dry in a
jar; spice pounded, &#38;c.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_vi'>vi</span>Where regular noonings or suppers are used
(and in every house some preparation is necessary
for accidental visitors), care  should be taken to
have such things in readiness as may be proper
for either; a list of several will be subjoined, a
change of which will be agreeable, and if properly
managed will be attended with no great expense.</p>

<p class='c010'>Every article should be kept in that place best
suited to it, as much waste may thereby be avoided,
viz.</p>

<p class='c010'>Vegetables will keep best on a stone floor if the
air be excluded; meat in a cold dry place; sugar
and sweetmeats require a dry place; so does salt;
candles cold, but not damp; dried meats, hams, &#38;c.
the same; all sorts of seeds for puddings, saloop,
rice, &#38;c. should be close covered to preserve from
insects. Flour should be kept in a cool perfectly
dry room, and the bag being tied should be changed
upside down and back every week, and well shaken.
Soap should be cut with a wire or twine, in pieces
that form a long square, when first brought in,
and kept out of the air two or three weeks; for if
it dry quick, it will crack, and when wet break.
Put it on a shelf, leaving a space between, and let
it grow hard gradually. Thus, it will save a full
third in the consumption. <span class='sc'>Cheese</span> should be
washed and wiped if you wish to preserve it sound,
and the shelves be washed; changing the place
every three or four weeks; but if it be wanted to
ripen, a damp cellar will bring it forward.</p>

<p class='c010'>Bread is now so heavy an article of expense that
all waste should be guarded against, and having it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_vii'>vii</span>cut in the room will tend much to prevent it; since
the scarcity in 1795 and 1800, that custom has
been much adopted. It should not be cut until a
day old; earthen pans and covers keep it best.</p>

<p class='c010'>Rolls, muffins, or any sort of bread, may be
made to taste new when two or three days old, by
dipping it uncut in water, and baking afresh or
toasting.</p>

<p class='c010'>Eggs may be bought cheapest when the hens
first begin to lay in the spring, before they sit;
in Lent and at Easter they become dear. They
may be preserved fresh by dipping them in boiling
water, and instantly taking them out, or by oiling
the shell; either of which ways is to prevent the
air passing through it. They should be kept on
shelves with small holes to receive one in each,
and be turned every other day.</p>

<p class='c010'>Carrots, parsnips, and beet roots, should be kept
in sand for winter use, and neither they nor potatoes
be cleared from the earth.</p>

<p class='c010'>Store onions preserve best hung up in a dry cold
room.</p>

<p class='c010'>Straw to lay apples on should be quite dry, to
prevent a musty taste.</p>

<p class='c010'>Large pears should be tied up by the stalk.</p>

<p class='c010'>Tarragon gives the flavour of French cookery,
and in high gravies is a great improvement; but
should be added only a short time before serving.</p>

<p class='c010'>Basil, savory, and knotted marjoram, or London
thyme, to be used when herbs are ordered; but
with discretion, as they are very pungent.</p>

<p class='c010'>Celery seeds give the flavour of the plant to soups.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_viii'>viii</span>Parsley should be cut close to the stalks, and
dried on tins in a very cool oven: it preserves its
flavour and colour, and is very useful in winter.</p>

<p class='c010'>Artichoke bottoms which have been slowly
dried, should be kept in paper bags; and truffles,
morels, lemonpeel, &#38;c. in a dry place ticketed.</p>

<p class='c010'>In towns, poultry being usually sold ready picked,
the feathers, which may occasionally come in in
small quantities, are neglected: but orders should
be given to put them into a tub free from damp,
and as they dry to change them into paper bags,
a few in each; they should hang in a dry kitchen
to season; fresh ones must not be added to those
in part dried, or they will occasion a musty smell,
but they should go through the same process. In
a few months they will be fit to add to beds, or to
make pillows, without the usual mode of drying
them in a cool oven, which may be pursued if they
are wanted before five or six months.</p>

<p class='c010'>The best means to preserve blankets from moths
is to fold and lay them under the featherbeds that
are in use, and they should be shaken occasionally.
When soiled, they should be washed, not scoured.</p>

<p class='c010'>Candles made in cool weather are best; and
when their price, and that of soap, which rise and
fall together, is likely to be higher, it will be prudent
to lay in the stock of both. This information
the chandler can always give; they are better for
keeping eight or ten months, and will not injure
for two years, if properly placed in the cool; and
there are few articles that better deserve care in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_ix'>ix</span>buying, and allowing a due quantity of, according
to the size of the family.</p>

<p class='c010'>The price of starch depends upon that of flour;
the best will keep good in a dry warm room for
some years; therefore when bread is cheap, it may
be bought to advantage, and covered close.</p>

<p class='c010'>Pickles and sweetmeats should be preserved
from air; where the former are much used, small
jars of each should be taken from the stock jar, to
prevent frequent opening.</p>

<p class='c010'>Some of the lemons and oranges used for juice
should be pared, first to preserve the peel dry;
some should be halved, and when squeezed, the
pulp cut out, and the outsides dried for grating.
If for boiling in any liquid, the first way is best.
When these fruits are cheap, a proper quantity
should be bought, and prepared as hereafter directed,
especially by those who live in the country,
where they cannot always be had; and they are
perpetually wanted in cookery.</p>

<p class='c010'>When whites of eggs are used for jelly, or other
purposes, contrive to have pudding, custard, &#38;c.
to employ the yelks also. Should you not want
them for several hours, beat them up with a little
water, and put them in a cool place, or they will
be hardened and useless. It was a mistake of old,
to think that the whites made cakes and puddings
heavy; on the contrary, if beaten long and separately,
they contribute greatly to give lightness, are
an advantage to paste, and make a pretty dish
beaten with fruit, to set in cream, &#38;c.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_x'>x</span>If copper utensils be used in the kitchen, the
cook should be charged to be very careful not to
let the tin be rubbed off; and to have them fresh
done when the least defect appears, and never to
put by any soup, gravy, &#38;c. in them, or any metal
utensil; stone and earthen vessels should be provided
for those purposes, as likewise plenty of
common dishes, that the table set may not be used
to put by cold meat.</p>

<p class='c010'>Vegetables soon sour, and corrode metals and
glazed red ware, by which a strong poison is produced.</p>

<p class='c010'>Vinegar by its acidity does the same, the glazing
being of lead or arsenic.</p>

<p class='c010'>In hot weather, when it is difficult to preserve
milk from becoming sour, and spoiling the cream,
it may be kept perfectly sweet by scalding the new
milk very gently, without boiling, and setting it by
in the earthen dish or pan that it is done in. This
method is pursued in Devonshire, and the milk
is not skimmed under twenty four hours, and
would equally answer in small quantities for coffee,
tea, &#38;c.</p>

<p class='c010'>Cream already skimmed may be kept twenty
four hours if scalded without sugar, and by adding
to it as much powdered lump sugar as shall make
it pretty sweet will be good two days, keeping it in
a cool place. Syrup of cream may be preserved
as above in the proportion of a pound and quarter
of sugar to a pint of perfectly fresh cream, keep it
in a cool place two or three hours; then put it in
one or two ounce phials, and cork it close. It will
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xi'>xi</span>keep good thus for several weeks, and will be found
very useful on voyages.</p>

<p class='c010'>To cool liquors in hot weather, dip a cloth in
cold water, and wrap it round the bottle two or
three times, then place it in the sun; renew the
process once or twice.</p>

<p class='c010'>The best way of scalding fruits, or boiling vinegar,
is in a stone jar on a hot iron hearth, or by
putting the vessel into a saucepan of water, called
a waterbath.</p>

<p class='c010'>The beautiful green given to pickles, formerly
was made by the use of bell mettle, brass, or copper,
and consequently very injurious to the stomach.</p>

<p class='c010'>If chocolate, coffee, jelly, gruel, bark, &#38;c. be suffered
to boil over, the strength is lost.</p>

<p class='c010'>Marbles boiled in custard, or any thing likely to
burn, will, by shaking them in the saucepan, prevent
it.</p>

<p class='c010'>Gravies or soups, put by, should be daily changed
into fresh scalded pans. When there is fear of
gravy meat being spoiled before it be wanted, season
it well, and lightly fry it, which will preserve
it two days longer; but the gravy is best when
the juices are fresh. A receipt for gravy that will
keep a week is given under the article of <span class='sc'>Sauces</span>.</p>

<p class='c010'>The cook should be encouraged to be careful of
coals and cinders: for the latter there is a new
contrivance to sift, without dispersing the dust of
the ashes, by means of a covered tin bucket.</p>

<p class='c010'>Small coal wetted makes the strongest fire for
the back, but must remain untouched until it cake.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xii'>xii</span>Cinders, lightly wet, give a great degree of heat,
and are better than coal for furnaces, ironing stoves,
and ovens.</p>

<p class='c010'>The cook should be charged to take care of jelly
bags, tapes for the collared things, &#38;c. which, if
not perfectly scalded, and kept dry, give an unpleasant
flavour when next used.</p>

<p class='c010'>Cold water thrown on cast iron, when hot, will
cause it to crack.</p>

<p class='c010'>Hard water spoils the colour of vegetables; a
pinch of pearlash, or salt of wormwood, will prevent
that effect.</p>

<p class='c010'>When sirloins of beef, loins of veal or mutton,
come in, part of the suet may be cut off for puddings,
or to clarify; dripping will baste every thing
as well as butter, fowls and game excepted; and
for kitchen pies, nothing else should be used.</p>

<p class='c010'>The fat off a neck or loin of mutton makes a far
lighter pudding than suet.</p>

<p class='c010'>Meat and vegetables that the frost has touched
should be soaked in cold water two or three hours
before they are used, or more if much iced. When
put into hot water or to the fire until thawed, no
heat will dress them properly.</p>

<p class='c010'>Meat should be well examined, when it comes
in warm weather; and if flies have touched it, the
part must be cut off, and then well washed. In the
height of summer, it is a very safe way to let meat
that is to be salted lie an hour in the coldest water,
rubbing it well there in any part likely to have
been flyblown; then wipe it perfectly dry, and have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xiii'>xiii</span>ready salt, and rub it thoroughly into every part,
leaving a handful over it besides. Turn it every
day, and rub the pickle in, which will make it
ready for the table in three or four days; if it is
desired to be very much corned, wrap it in a well
floured cloth, having rubbed it previously with salt.
The latter method will corn fresh beef fit for table
the day it comes in; but it must be put into the pot
when the water boils.</p>

<p class='c010'>If the weather permits, meat eats much better
for hanging two or three days before it be salted.</p>

<p class='c010'>The water in which meat has boiled makes an
excellent soup for the poor, when vegetables, oatmeal
or pease, are added, and should not be cleared
from the fat.</p>

<p class='c010'>Roast beef bones, or shank bones of ham, make
fine pease soup, and should be boiled with the
pease the day before eaten, that the fat may be removed.</p>

<p class='c010'>The mistress of the house will find many great
advantages in visiting her larder daily, before she
orders her bill of fare: she will see what things
require dressing, and thereby guard against their
being spoiled. Many articles may be re-dressed
in a different form from that in which they were
first served, and improve the appearance of the
table without increasing expense. Many dishes require
to be made of dressed meat or fowls. Directions
for several are hereafter given.</p>

<p class='c010'>In every sort of provisions, the best of the kind
goes farthest; cutting out most advantageously,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xiv'>xiv</span>and affording most nourishment. Round of beef,
fillet of veal, and leg of mutton, bear a higher
price; but having more solid meat, deserve the
preference. It is worth notice, however, that those
joints which are inferior may be dressed as palatably,
and being cheaper, ought to be bought in turn;
and, when weighed with the prime pieces, the price
of the latter is reduced.</p>

<p class='c010'>In loins of meat, the long pipe which runs by the
bone should be taken out, being apt to taint; as
likewise the kernels of beef. Rumps and aitchbones
of beef are often bruised by the blows the
drovers give, and that part always taints: avoid
purchasing such.</p>

<p class='c010'>The shank bones of mutton should be saved, and,
after soaking and brushing, may be added to give
richness to gravies or soups; and they are particularly
nourishing for the sick.</p>

<p class='c010'>The feet of pork make various good dishes, and
should be cut off before the legs be cured. Observe
the same of the ears.</p>

<p class='c010'>Calves’ tongues, salted, make a more useful dish
than when dressed with the brains, which may be
served without.</p>

<p class='c010'>Some people like neats’ tongues cured with the
root, in which case they look much larger; but
should the contrary be approved, the root must be
cut off close to the gullet, next to the tongue, but
without taking away the fat under the tongue. The
root must be soaked in salt and water, and extremely
well cleaned before it be dressed as hereafter
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xv'>xv</span>directed: and the tongue laid in salt for a day
and night before pickled.</p>

<p class='c010'>Great attention is requisite in salting meat; and
in the country, where great quantities are cured,
it is of still more importance. Beef and pork should
be well sprinkled, and a few hours after hung to
drain, before it be rubbed with the preserving salts;
which mode, by cleansing the meat from the blood,
tends to keep it from tasting strong. It should be
turned daily, and if wanted soon, rubbed. A salting
tub, or lead, may be used, and a cover should
fit close. Those who use a good deal of salt meat
will find it answer well to boil up the pickle, skim,
and, when cold, pour it over meat that has been
sprinkled and drained. Salt is so greatly increased
in price, from the heavy duties, as to require
additional care, and the brine ought not to be
thrown away, as is the practice of some, after once
using.</p>

<p class='c010'>In some families great loss is sustained by the
spoiling of meat. The best mode to keep that
which is to be eaten unsalted is, as before directed,
to examine it well; wipe it daily, and pound some
charcoal, and throw over it. If meat is brought
from a distance in warm weather, the butcher
should be charged to cover it close, and bring it
early in the morning; but even then, if it be kept
on the road, while he serves the customers who
are nearest to him, it will probably be flyblown.
This is most frequent in the country.</p>

<p class='c010'>Mutton will keep long by washing with vinegar,
and peppering the broad end of the leg; if any
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xvi'>xvi</span>damp appears, wipe it immediately. If rubbed with
salt lightly, it will not eat the worse. Boiled in seawater,
is by some much admired.</p>

<p class='c010'>Game is often brought in when not likely to keep
a day, in the cook’s apprehension; yet may be
preserved two or three days, if wanted, by the following
method:</p>

<p class='c010'>If birds, (woodcocks and snipes excepted, which
must not be drawn) draw them, pick, and take out
the crop; wash them in two or three waters, and
rub them with a little salt. Have ready a large
saucepan of boiling water, and plunge them in one
by one; boil each five minutes, moving it, that the
water may go through them. When all are finished,
hang them by the heads in a cold place;
when drained, pepper the inside and necks. When
to be roasted, wash to take off the pepper. The
most delicate birds, even grouse, may be kept this
way, if not putrid. Birds that live by suction, &#38;c.
bear being high; it is probable that the heat
might cause them to taint more, as a free passage
for the scalding water could not be obtained. Hares
ought not to be paunched in the field, as they
keep longer, and eat much better without. But
that is seldom in the cook’s power to guard
against. She should take out the liver and heart,
and parboil the former to keep for stuffing, wipe
the inside every day, quite dry, put a bunch of parsley,
or some pepper, or both; thus it will keep
long, especially if the seasoning be rubbed early on
the inside to prevent any mustiness of taste, which
often is communicated to the stuffing by this omission,
and want of extreme nicety in washing it in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xvii'>xvii</span>water and vinegar before it be dressed, while the
outside has been preserved fresh by the skin. If
old, a hare should be kept as long as possible, except
for soup, or jugging; and after soaking, in
vinegar, be well larded.</p>

<p class='c010'>Freshwater fish has often a muddy taste; to take
off which, soak it in strong salt and water, or, if of a
size to bear it, give it a scald in the same, after extremely
good cleaning and washing. The latter
for carp or eels.</p>

<p class='c010'>Turbot will hang three or four days, if lightly
rubbed with salt, and be in quite as great perfection
as the first day.</p>

<p class='c010'>Fish may sometimes be bought reasonably by
taking more than can be dressed at once; when
recourse may be had to pickling, potting, or frying,
to keep for stewing a succeeding day.</p>

<p class='c010'>When thunder or hot weather causes beer to
turn sour, half, or a whole teaspoonful of salt of
wormwood should be put into a jug, and let the
beer be drawn in it as small a time as possible before
it be drank.</p>

<p class='c010'>If the subject of servants be thought ill timed in
a book upon family arrangement, it must be by
those who do not recollect that the regularity and
good management of the heads will be insufficient,
if not seconded by those who are to execute orders.
It behoves every person to be extremely careful
who they take into their employ; to be very minute
in investigating the character they receive; and
equally cautious to be scrupulously just in giving
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xviii'>xviii</span>one to others. Were this attended to, many bad people
would be incapacitated from doing mischief, by
abusing the trust reposed in them. And it may be
fairly asserted, that the robbery, or waste (which is
but a milder epithet) of an unfaithful servant, will
be laid to the charge of the master or mistress,
who, knowing such faults in him, or even having
only well grounded suspicions, is led by entreaty or
false pity, to slide him into another place. To refuse
countenance to the evil, is to encourage the
good servant; such as are honest, frugal, and attentive
to their duties, should be liberally rewarded:
and such discrimination would encourage merit,
and inspire servants with a zeal to acquit themselves
with fidelity.</p>

<p class='c010'>On the other side it may be proper to observe,
that a retributive justice usually marks persons in
that station sooner or later even in this world.
Those who are extravagant and idle in their servitude,
are ill prepared for the industry and sobriety
on which their own future welfare much depends;
their faults, and the attendant punishment,
come home when they have families of their own,
and sometimes much sooner. They will see their
wickedness or folly in the conduct of their offspring,
whom they must not expect to be better than the
examples that are set them.</p>

<p class='c010'>It was the observation of a sensible woman, that
she could always read the fate of her servants when
they married from her; those who had been faithful
and industrious in her service, continued their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xix'>xix</span>good habits in their own families, and became respectable
members of the community; those who had
been unfaithful servants, never were successful, and
not unfrequently were reduced to the parish.</p>

<p class='c010'>The manner of carving is not only a very essential
knowledge in point of doing the honours of the
table with grace, but makes a great difference in
the family consumption; and, though in large companies,
a lady is so much assisted as to make the
art of less consequence, yet she should not fail to
acquaint herself with an attainment of which she
must daily feel the want. Some people haggle
meat so as not to be able to help six times from a
large tongue, or a piece of beef. It is to be observed
that a thin sharp carving knife, and with a
very little strength to the management of it, will
cut deep thin slices, cause the joint to look neatly,
and leave sufficient for a second helping, instead of
that disgusting appearance which is sometimes observable.
Habit alone can make people carve, or
do the honours of a table well; for those who have
not had practice, there are very good directions in
a little book of Trusler’s.</p>

<p class='c010'>In the following, and indeed all other receipts,
though the quantities may be as accurately set
down as possible, yet much must be left to the discretion
of the person who uses them. The different
taste of people requires more or less of the flavour
of spices, garlic, butter, &#38;c. which can never
be directed by general rules; and if the cook has not
a good taste, and attention to that of her employers,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xx'>xx</span>not all the ingredients with which nature or art can
furnish her, will give an exquisite relish to her
dishes. The proper articles should be at hand, and
she must proportion them until the true zest be obtained.</p>

  <h2 class='c006'>FISH.</h2>
</div>
<h3 class='c011'><i>To boil Turbot.</i></h3>
<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c012'>The turbot kettle must be of a proper size, and in
the nicest order. Set the fish in cold water to cover
it completely: throw a handful of salt and one glass
of vinegar into it; let it gradually boil; be very careful
that there fall no blacks, but skim it well, and
preserve the beauty of the colour.</p>

<p class='c010'>Serve it garnished with a complete fringe of curled
parsley, lemon, and horseradish.</p>

<p class='c010'>The sauce must be the finest lobster, and anchovy
butter, and plain butter, served plentifully in separate
tureens.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>To stew Lamprey, as at Worcester.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>After cleaning the fish carefully, remove the cartilage
which runs down the back, and season with a
small quantity of cloves, mace, nutmeg, pepper, and
pimento. Put it in a small stewpot, with very strong
beef gravy, with port and equal quantity of Madeira
or sherry wine.</p>

<p class='c010'>It must be covered; stew till tender; then take
out the lamprey and keep it hot, while you boil up
the liquor with two or three anchovies chopped, and
some flour and butter: strain the gravy through a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2'>2</span>sieve, and add lemon juice and some made mustard.
Serve with sippets of bread and horseradish.</p>

<p class='c010'>Eels, soals, and carp, done the same way, are excellent.
When there is spawn, it must be fried
and put round.</p>

<p class='c010'>Note. Cyder instead of white wine will do in
common.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Eel Pye.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Cut the eels in lengths of two or three inches:
season with pepper and salt, and place in the dish,
with some bits of butter and a little water, and cover
it with paste.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Spitchcock Eels.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Take a large one, leave the skin on, cut it in
pieces of four inches long, open it on the belly side,
and clean it nicely: wipe it dry, and then wet it
with a beaten egg, and strew it over on both sides
with chopped parsley, pepper, salt, a very little
sage, and a bit of mace pounded fine, and mixed
with the seasoning. Rub the gridiron with a bit
of suet, and broil the fish of a fine colour.</p>

<p class='c010'>Serve with anchovy and butter for sauce.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Fried Eels.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>If small, they should be curled round and fried,

</div>

<p class='c014'>Clean and divide, then cut each side in three;
or, leaving them undivided, cut each fish in five or
six pieces. To six large mackerel, take near an
ounce of pepper, two nutmegs, a little mace, four
cloves, and a handful of salt, all in finest powder;
mix, and, making holes in each bit of fish, thrust
the seasoning into them; rub each piece with some
of it; then fry them brown in oil; let them stand
till cold, then put them into a stone jar, and cover
with vinegar: if to keep long, pour oil on the top.
This done, they may be preserved for months.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>To bake Pike.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Scale it, and open as near the throat as you can;
then stuff it with the following: grated bread,
herbs, anchovies, oysters, suet, salt, pepper, mace,
half a pint of cream, four yelks of eggs; mix all,
over the fire, till it thickens, then put it into the fish,
sew it up. Butter should be put over in little bits:
bake it. Serve sauce of gravy, butter, and anchovy.
<i>Note.</i> If, in helping a pike, the back and belly be
slit up, and each slice be gently drawn downwards,
there will be fewer bones given.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Salmon to boil.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Clean it carefully, boil it gently, and take it out
of the water as soon as done; and let the water be
warm if the fish be split.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>
  <h3 class='c013'><i>Salmon to pickle.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Boil as above, take the fish out and boil the liquor
with bayleaves, peppercorns and salt; add vinegar
when cold, and pour over the fish.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Salmon to broil.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Cut slices about an inch thick; season, and put
them into papers; twist them, and broil gently.
Serve in the papers. Anchovy sauce.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Salmon to pot.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Take a large piece, scale and wipe, but do not wash
it; salt it very well: let it lie till the salt be melted
and drained from it, then season with beaten mace,
cloves, and whole peppers. Lay in a few bayleaves,
put it close in a pan, and cover it over with
butter, and bake it. When well done, drain it from
the gravy, put it in the pots to keep; and when
cold, cover with clarified butter.</p>

<p class='c010'>Thus you may do any firm fish.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Salmon to dry.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Cut the fish down, take out the inside and roe.
Rub the whole with common salt, after scaling it;
let it hang to drain twenty four hours. Pound three
or four ounces of saltpetre, according to the size of
the fish, two ounces of bay salt, and two ounces of
coarse sugar: rub these, when mixed well, into the
Salmon, and lay it on a large dish or tray two
days, then rub it well with common salt, and in
twenty four hours more it will be fit to dry: but
you must dry it well after draining. Either hang
in a wood chimney, or in a dry place, keeping it
open with two small sticks.</p>

<p class='c014'>Boil them half, pick out the meat, cut into small
bits: season with mace, white pepper, nutmeg,
and salt: press close into a pot and cover with butter:
bake half an hour: put the spawn in. When
cold, take the lobster out, and with a little of the butter
put it into the pots. Beat the other butter in a
mortar with some of the spawn; then mix that
coloured butter with as much as will be sufficient
to cover the pots, and strain it. Cayenne may be
added, if approved.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Another way, as at Wood’s Hotel.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Take out the meat as whole as you can; split
the tail and remove the gut; if the inside be not
watery, add that. Season with mace, nutmeg,
white pepper, salt, and a clove or two, in finest
powder. Lay a little fine butter at the bottom of a
pan, and the lobster smooth over it, with bayleaves
between: cover it with butter and bake it gently.
When done, pour the whole on the bottom of a
sieve, and with a fork lay the pieces into potting
pots, some of each sort with the seasoning about
it. When cold, pour clarified butter over, but not
hot. It will be good next day; or highly seasoned,
and thick covered with butter, will keep
some time.</p>

<p class='c010'>The potted lobster may be used cold, or as a fricassee,
with a cream sauce, when it looks very
nicely, and eats excellently, especially if there be
spawn.</p>

<p class='c010'>Mackerel, herrings, and trout, are good potted as

<p class='c014'>Pick the lobster, put the berries into a dish that
has a lamp, and rub them down with a bit of butter,
two spoonfuls of any sort of gravy, one of soy
or walnut catsup, a little salt and Cayenne, and a
spoonful of port. Stew the lobster cut in bits with
the gravy as above. It must be dressed at table,
and eaten immediately.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Lobster Pie.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Boil two lobsters, or three small; take out the

four pieces and lay them in a small dish. Put in
then the meat of the claws, and that you have
picked out of the body; pick off the furry parts from
the latter, and take out the lady; then take the
spawn, beat it in a mortar, likewise all the shells.
Set them on to stew with some water, two or three
spoonfuls of vinegar, pepper, salt, and some pounded
mace. A large piece of butter, rolled in flour, must
be added when the goodness of the shells is obtained.
Give a boil or two and pour into the dish

the head, then put the former, with a very small bit
of nutmeg, salt, pepper, a bit of butter, crumbs of
bread, and three spoonfuls of vinegar, into the shell
again, and set it before the fire. You may brown
it with a salamander.</p>

<p class='c010'>Dry toast should be served to eat it upon.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>To dress Red Herrings.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Choose those that are large and moist; cut them
open, and pour some boiling small beer over them,
to soak half an hour. Drain them dry, and make
them just hot through before the fire; then rub
some cold butter over them and serve. Egg sauce,
or buttered eggs and mashed potatoes, should be
served with them.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Baked Herrings or Sprats.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Wash and drain without wiping them. Season
with Jamaica pepper in fine powder, salt, a whole
clove or two: lay them in a pan with plenty of
black pepper, an onion, and a few bayleaves. Put
half vinegar and half small beer, enough to cover
them. Put paper over the pan, and bake in a slow
oven. If you like, throw saltpetre over them the
night before, to make them look red. Gut, but
do not open them.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>To smoke Herrings.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Clean and lay them in salt, and a little saltpetre
one night; then hang them on a stick, through
the eyes, on a row. Have ready an old cask, on
which put some sawdust, and in the midst of it a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>heater red hot; over the smoke fix the stick, and
let them remain twenty four hours.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Fried Herrings.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Serve them of a light brown, and onions sliced
and fried.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Broiled Herrings.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Floured first, and done of a good colour. Plain
butter for sauce. They are very good potted like
mackerel.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Soals.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>If boiled, they must be served with great care to
look perfectly white, and should be much covered
with parsley.</p>

<p class='c010'>If fried, dip them in egg, and cover them with
fine crumbs of bread. Set on a fryingpan that is
just large enough, and put into it a large quantity
of fresh lard or dripping; boil it, and immediately
slip the fish into it. Do them of a fine
brown. When enough, take them out carefully,
and lay them upon a dish turned under side uppermost,
and placed slantingly before the fire to
drain off the fat. If you wish them to be particularly
nice, lay them on clean cap paper, and let lie
some minutes.</p>

<p class='c010'>Observe, that fish never looks well if not fried in
plenty of fat, and <i>that</i> boiling hot, before it be put
into it. The dripping may serve again with a little
fresh. Take care the fat does not become black.
Butter makes every thing black that is fried in it.
The soals should just fit the inside of the dish, and
a fringe of curled parsley garnish the edge completely,
which looks beautifully.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>Soals that have been fried, eat good cold with

<h3 class='c013'><i>Soals, in the Portuguese way.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Take one large or two lesser; if the former, cut
the fish in two; if they are small, they need only
be split. The bones being taken out, put the fish
into a pan, with a bit of butter and some lemonjuice:
give it a fry; then lay the fish on a dish,
and spread a forcemeat over each piece, and roll it
round, fastening the roll with a few small skewers.
Lay the rolls into a small earthen pan; beat an
egg and wet them, then strew crumbs over,
and put the remainder of the egg, with a little
meat gravy, a spoonful of caper liquor, an anchovy
chopped fine, and some parsley chopped,
into the bottom of the pan; cover it close, and
bake, until the fish be done enough, in a slow
oven. Then place the rolls in the dish for serving;
cover it to keep it hot until the gravy baked be
skimmed: if not enough, a little fresh, flavoured
as above, must be prepared and added to it.</p>

two or three yelks of eggs.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>The heads of the fish are to be left on one side

time cut the flesh of the eels fine, likewise some
lemonpeel, parsley, and an anchovy: put to them
pepper, salt, nutmeg, and some crumbs. Melt
four ounces of butter and mix, then lay it in a dish
at the bottom: cut the flesh of two or three soals
clean from the bones, and fins; lay it on the forcemeat,
and pour the eelbroth in. The bones of the
soals should be boiled with those of the eels. You
may boil them with one or two little eels, and pour
it, well seasoned, on the fish, and put no forcemeat.</p>

shake it off. Dip them in plenty of egg, then into
bread crumbs grated fine, and plunge them into
a good pan of boiling lard. Let them continue
gently boiling, and a few minutes will make them
a bright yellow brown. Take care not to take off
the light roughness of the crumbs, or their beauty
will be lost.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Boiled Carp.</i></h3>

  <h2 class='c006'>OBSERVATIONS ON DRESSING FISH.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c015'>If the fishmonger does not clean it, fish is seldom
very nicely done; but those in great towns
wash it beyond what is necessary for cleaning, and
by perpetual watering diminish the flavor. When
quite clean, if to be boiled, some salt and a little
vinegar should be put to the water to give firmness;
but cod, whiting and haddock, are far better if a little
salted, and kept a day; and if not very hot weather
they will be good in two days.</p>

<p class='c010'>Those who know how to purchase fish, may, by
taking more at a time than they want for one day,
often get it cheap, and that which will hang by
sprinkling, may then be bought to advantage.</p>

<p class='c010'>The fish must be put into the water while cold,
and set to do very gently, or the outside will break
before the inner part be done.</p>

<p class='c010'>The fishplate on which it is done, may be drawn
up to see if it be ready; it will leave the bone
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>when it is. It should be then immediately taken
out of the water, or it will be woolly. The fishplate
should be set crossways over the kettle, to
keep hot for serving, and a clean cloth should cover
the fish to prevent its losing its colour.</p>

<p class='c010'>Small fish, nicely fried in egg, and crumbs, make
a dish of fish far more elegant than served plain.
Great attention should be paid to garnishing fish;
plenty of horseradish, parsley, and lemon.</p>

<p class='c010'>When well done, and with very good sauce, fish
is more attended to than almost any other dish.
The liver and roe should be placed on the dish, so
conspicuously that the lady may see them, and help
a part to every one. The sound of the cod, its
head, and the head of carp are reckoned the prime
parts; and it is a part of necessary attention to
help, or at least offer some of the best to one’s
friends; nor is it any excuse for the mistress’s
negligence, that it is the fashion of the present day
for those who sit at her right or left hand to help
the company, which she must see they do properly.</p>

<p class='c010'>If salmon is to be dressed, great care is necessary
that it be done enough. No vinegar should
be boiled with it.</p>

<p class='c010'>If fish is to be fried or broiled, it must be wrapt
in a nice soft cloth, after it is well cleaned and
washed. When perfectly dry, wet with an egg, if
the former way, and sprinkle the finest crumbs of
bread over it; then having a thick bottomed fryingpan
on the fire, with a large quantity of lard or
dripping boiling hot, plunge the fish into it, and let
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>it fry middlingly quick, till the colour be a fine
brown yellow, and it be judged ready: if the latter
take place first, the cook should draw the pan
to the side of the fire, lest the colour be spoiled.
She should then carefully take it up, and either
place it on a large sieve turned upwards, and to be
kept for that purpose only, or on the underside of
a dish, to drain; and if wanted very nice, a sheet
of cap paper must be put to receive the fish, which
should look a beautiful colour, and all the crumbs
appear distinct; the fish being free from all grease.</p>

<p class='c010'>Garnish with a fringe of curled raw parsley, or
parsley fried, which must be thus done: when
washed and picked, throw it again into clean water;
when the lard or dripping boils, throw the parsley
into it immediately from the water, and instantly
it will be green, and crisp, and must be taken up
with a slice. This may be done after the fish is
fried.</p>

<p class='c010'>If fish is to be broiled, it must be seasoned and
floured, and put on a gridiron that is very clean;
and when hot, it should be rubbed with a bit of
suet to prevent the fish from sticking. It must be
broiled on a very clear fire, that it may not taste
of smoke; and not too near, that it may not be
scorched.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>An excellent imitation of Sturgeon.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Take a fine large, but not an old turkey; pick it
most nicely; singe it, and make it very clean;
bone, wash, and dry it; tie it across and across,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>with a bit of mat string, washed clean, as they tie
sturgeon. Put into a very nice tin saucepan a
quart of water, the same of vinegar, and of white wine,
that is not sweet, and a very large handful
of salt. Let boil, and skim well, then put in the
turkey: when done, take it out and tighten the
strings. Let the liquor boil half an hour after,
and when cold put it on the turkey. If salt or
vinegar be wanting, add when cold. This will
keep some months. You eat it with oil and vinegar,
or sugar and vinegar. It is more delicate
than sturgeon, and makes a pretty variety, if the
real is not to be had. Cover it with fennel when
brought to table.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c006'>ON DRESSING MEATS.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c015'>Wash all meats before you dress; if for boiling,
the colour will be better for soaking; if for roasting,
dry it.</p>

<p class='c010'>Boiling in a well floured cloth, will make meat
white.</p>

<p class='c010'>Particular charge must be given that the pot be
well skimmed the <i>moment</i> it boils, otherwise the
foulness will be dispersed over the meat. The
more soups or broths are skimmed, the better and
cleaner they will be.</p>

<p class='c010'>The boiler and utensils should be kept delicately
clean.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>Put the meat in cold water, and flour it well
first. If meat be boiled quick it will be hard; but
care must be taken that in boiling slow it does not
cease, or the meat will be underdone.</p>

<p class='c010'>If the steam be kept in, the water will not much
decrease; therefore when you wish to evaporate,
remove the cover of the soup pot.</p>

<p class='c010'>Vegetables should not be dressed with the meat,
except carrots or parsnips with boiled beef.</p>

<p class='c010'>Weigh the joint, and allow a quarter of an hour
to each pound, and about twenty minutes over. If
for roasting, it should be put at a good distance
from the fire, and brought gradually nearer when
the inner part becomes hot, which will prevent its
being scorched while yet raw. Meat should be
much basted, and when nearly done, floured to
make it look frothed.</p>

<p class='c010'>Veal and mutton should have a little paper put
over the fat to preserve it. If not fat enough to
allow for basting, a little good dripping answers as
well as butter.</p>

<p class='c010'>The cook should be careful to spit meat so as
not to run the spit through the best parts; and she
should observe that her spit be well cleaned before,
and when she is going to serve, or a black stain
appears on the meat. In many joints the spit will
pass into the bones, and run along them for some
distance, so as not to injure the prime of the meat;
and she should have leaden skewers to enable her
to balance it; for want of which, ignorant servants
often are foiled in the time of serving.</p>

<p class='c010'>In roasting meat, it is a very good way to put a
little salt and water into the dripping pan, and baste
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>for a little while with it before it be done with its
own fat or dripping. When dry, dust it with flour,
and baste as usual.</p>

<p class='c010'>Time, distance, basting often, and a clear fire, of
a proper size for what is required, are the first articles
of a good cook’s attention in roasting.</p>

<p class='c010'>Old meats do not require so much dressing as
young: not that they are sooner done, but they can
be eaten with the gravy more in.</p>

<p class='c010'>Be careful in roasting wild fowls to keep a clear
brisk fire. Roast them of a light brown, but not
till their gravy runs; they loose their fine flavour if
too much done. Tame fowls require more roasting:
they are a long time before they are hot
through, and must be often basted to keep up a
froth, and it makes the colour better. Pigs and
geese require a brisk fire, and to be turned quick.</p>

<p class='c010'>Hares and rabbits require time, and care to turn
the two ends to the fire, which are less likely to be
done enough than the middle part.</p>

<p class='c010'>Choose mutton by the fineness of its grain, the
deep red of the flesh, and bright whiteness of the
fat. For roasting, it should hang as long as it will
keep, the hind quarter especially, but not so as to
taint; for, whatever fashion may authorize, putrid
juices ought not to be conveyed into the stomach.</p>

<p class='c010'>Mutton, for boiling, will not look of a good colour
if it has long hung. Small mutton is preferred.</p>

<p class='c010'>Great care should be taken to preserve by paper
the fat of what is roasted.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>
  <h3 class='c013'><i>To keep Venison.</i></h3>
</div>

<p class='c014'>Preserve the venison dry; wash it with milk and
water very clean; dry it with clean cloths, till not
the least damp remain. Then dust pounded ginger
over every part, which is a good preventive
against the fly. By thus managing and watching,
it will hang a fortnight. When to be used, wash
it with a little lukewarm water, and dry it.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Venison.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>A haunch of buck will take about three hours and
three quarters roasting; doe, three hours and a
quarter. Put a coarse paste of brown flour and
water, and a paper over that, to cover all the fat:
baste it well with dripping, and keep it at a distance
to get hot at the bone by degrees. When nearly
done, remove the covering, and baste it with butter,
and froth it up before you serve.</p>

<p class='c010'>Gravy for it should be put into a boat, and not
in the dish (unless there be none in the venison),
and made thus: cut off the fat from two or three
pounds of a loin of old mutton, and set it in steaks
on a gridiron for a few minutes, just to brown one
side: put them in a saucepan, with a quart of
water: cover quite close for an hour, and gently
simmer it; then uncover, and stew till the gravy
be reduced to a point. Season with only salt.</p>

<p class='c010'>Currantjelly sauce must be served in a boat.</p>

<p class='c010'>Formerly pap sauce was eaten with venison,
which, as some still like it, may be necessary to
direct. Grate white bread, and boil it with port and
water, a large stick of cinnamon; and when quite
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>smooth, remove the latter, and add sugar. Claret
wine may be used for it.</p>

<p class='c010'>Make the jelly sauce thus. Beat some currantjelly,
and a spoonful or two of port, then set it over
the fire till melted. Where jelly runs short, put
more wine, and a few lumps of sugar to the jelly,
and melt as above.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>To make a Pasty of Beef or Mutton, to eat as well as Venison.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Bone a small rump, or a piece of sirloin of beef,
or a fat loin of mutton: the former is better than
mutton, after hanging several days, if the weather
permits. Beat it very well with a rolling pin, then
rub ten pounds of meat with four ounces of sugar,
and pour over it a glass of port wine, and the same of
vinegar. Let it lie five days and nights: wash and
wipe the meat very dry, and season it very
high with pepper, Jamaica pepper, nutmeg, and
salt. Lay in your dish, and to ten pounds put one
pound or near of butter, spreading it over the meat.
Put a crust round the edges, and cover with a
thick one, or it will be overdone before the meat be
soaked. It must be done in a slow oven.</p>

<p class='c010'>Set the bones in a pan in the oven, with no more
water than will cover them, and one glass of port
wine, a little pepper and salt, that you may have a
little rich gravy to add to the pasty when drawn.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Note.</i> Sugar gives a greater shortness, and better
flavor to meats than salt, too great a quantity of
which hardens; and it is quite as great a preservative.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>
  <h3 class='c013'><i>Haunch, Neck and Shoulders of Venison.</i></h3>
</div>

<p class='c014'>Roast with paste, as directed above, and the same
sauce.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Stewed Shoulder.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Let the meat hang till you judge proper to dress
it, then take out the bone: beat the meat with a
rolling pin. Lay some slices of mutton fat, that
has lain a few hours in a little port wine, among
it: sprinkle a little black and Jamaica pepper over
it, in finest powder: roll it up tight, and fillet it.
Set it in a stewpan that will only just hold it, with
some mutton or beef gravy, not strong, half a pint
of port, and some pepper and pimento. Simmer,
close covered, and as slow as you can, for three or
four hours. When quite tender, take off the tape,
set the meat on a dish, and strain the gravy over.
Serve with currantjelly sauce.</p>

<p class='c010'>This is the best way to dress this joint, unless it
be very fat, and then it should be roasted. The
bone should be stewed with it.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>To prepare Venison for Pasty.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Take the bones out, then season and beat the
meat. Lay it in a stone jar in large pieces: pour
upon it some plain drawn beef gravy, but not a
strong one: lay the bones on top, then set the jar
in a waterbath, that is, a saucepan of water over the
fire; simmer three or four hours; then leave it
in a cold place till next day. Remove the cake of
fat, and lay the meat in handsome pieces on the
dish: if not sufficiently seasoned, add more pepper,
salt, or pimento, as necessary. Put some of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>gravy, and keep the remainder for the time of
serving. If the venison be thus prepared, it will
not require so much time to bake, or such a very
thick crust as is usual, and by which the under part
is seldom done through.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Venison Pasty.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>A shoulder, boned, makes a good pasty; but it
must be beaten and seasoned, and the want of fat
supplied by that of a fine well hung loin of mutton,
steeped twenty four hours in equal parts of rape,
vinegar, and port.</p>

<p class='c010'>The shoulder being sinewy, it will be of advantage
to rub it well with sugar for two or three days;
and when to be used, wipe it perfectly clean from it,
and the wine.</p>

<p class='c010'>A mistake used to prevail, that venison could
not be baked enough; but, as above directed, three
or four hours in a slow oven will be sufficient to
make it tender, and the flavor will be preserved.
Either in shoulder or side, the meat must be cut
in pieces, and laid with fat between, that it may be
proportioned to each person, without breaking up
the pasty to find it. Lay some pepper and salt, at
the bottom of the dish, and some butter, then the
meat nicely packed, that it may be sufficiently
done, but not lie hollow to harden at the edges.</p>

<p class='c010'>The venison bones should be boiled with some
fine old mutton. Of this gravy put half a pint cold
into the dish, then lay butter on the venison, and
cover, as well as line the sides with a thick crust;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>but do not put one under the meat. Keep the remainder
of the gravy till the pasty comes from the
oven; put it into the middle by a funnel, quite hot,
and shake the dish to mix well. It should be seasoned
with pepper and salt.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>An imitation of Venison Pasty.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Choose a large well fed loin of mutton; hang it
ten days, then bone it, leaving the meat as whole
as possible. Cover it with brown sugar a day and
night; then lay it in a pickle of half a pint of port
wine, and half a pint of rape or common vinegar,
twenty four hours more: then shake it well in it to
take off the sugar, but do not wash, only wipe it.
Season as above, and bake; making a gravy of the
bones.</p>

<p class='c010'>Crust for the pasty, see under the article of
crusts.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Hashed Venison</i>,</h3>

<p class='c014'>Should be warmed with its own, or gravy without
seasoning, as before, and only warmed through,
not boiled. If there be no fat left, cut some slices
of mutton fat, set on the fire, with a little port wine
and sugar: simmer till dry; then add it to the hash,
and it will eat as well as that of the venison.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Beef or Pork, to be salted for eating immediately.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>The piece should not weigh more than five or
six pounds. Salt it very thoroughly just before you
put it in the pot. Take a coarse cloth, flour it
well, put the meat in and fold it up close. Put it
into a pot of boiling water, and boil it as long as you
would any salt beef of the same size, and it will be
as salt as if done four or five days.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>
  <h3 class='c013'><i>Beef Alamode.</i></h3>
</div>

<p class='c014'>Choose a piece of thick flank of a fine heifer or
ox. Cut into long slices some fat bacon, but quite
free from yellow. Let each bit be near an inch
thick, and dip them in vinegar, and then in a seasoning
ready prepared of salt, black and Jamaica
peppers and a clove in finest powder, with parsley,
chives, thyme, savory and knotted marjorum, shred
as small as possible, and well mixed. With a sharp
knife make holes deep enough to let in the larding;
then rub the beef over with the seasoning, and
bind it up tight with tape. Set it in a well tinned
pot over a fire or rather stove. Three or four
onions must be fried brown and put to the beef,
with two or three carrots, one turnip, and a head
or two of celery, and a small quantity of water.
Let it simmer gently ten or twelve hours, or till
extremely tender, turning the meat twice.</p>

<p class='c010'>Put the gravy in a pan, remove the fat, keep the
beef covered, then put them together, and add a
glass of port wine. Remove the tape, and serve
with the vegetables: or you may strain them
off, and send up fresh, cut in dice for garnish.
Onions roasted, and then stewed with the gravy,
are a great improvement. A teacup full of vinegar
should be stewed with the beef.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Stewed rump of Beef.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Wash it well: season it high with pepper, Cayenne,
salt, Jamaica pepper, three cloves, a blade of
mace, all in finest powder. Bind it up tight, and
lay it in a pot that will just hold it. Fry three large
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>onions, sliced, and put to it, with three carrots, two
turnips, a shalot, four cloves, a blade of mace, and
some celery. Cover the meat with good beef broth,
or weak gravy. Simmer as gently as possible for
several hours, till quite tender. Clear off the fat,
and add to the gravy half a pint of port wine, a
glass of vinegar, and a large spoonful of catsup;
simmer half an hour, and serve in a deep dish.</p>

<p class='c010'>Garnish with carrots, turnips, or truffles, and
morels, or pickles of different colours cut small,
and laid in little heaps separate, chopped parsley,
chives, beetroot, &#38;c. If when done the gravy be
too much to fill the dish, take only a part to season
for serving: the less wafer the better; and to increase
the richness, add a few beef bones and shanks
of mutton in stewing.</p>

<p class='c010'>A spoonful or two of made mustard is a great
improvement to the gravy.</p>

<p class='c010'>Rump roasted is excellent; but in the country
is generally sold whole with the edgebone, or cut
across instead of lengthways, as in London, when
there is one piece for boiling, and the rump for
stewing or roasting.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Stewed Brisket.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Put the part that has the hard fat into a stew
pot, with a small quantity of water; let it boil up,
and skim it thoroughly; then add carrots, turnips,
onions, celery, and a few peppercorns. Stew
till extremely tender; then take out the flat bones,
and remove all the fat from the soup. Either serve
that and the meat in a tureen, or the former alone,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>and the meat on a dish, garnished with some of the
vegetables. The following sauce is much admired,
served with the beef. Take half a pint of the soup,
and mix with a spoonful of catsup, a glass of port
wine, a teaspoonful of made mustard, a little flour,
a bit of butter, and salt: boil all together a few
minutes, then pour it round the meat. Chop capers,
walnuts, red cabbage, pickled cucumbers, and
chives or parsley, small, and put in separate heaps
over it.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>To salt Beef red, which is extremely good to eat fresh from the pickle, or to hang to dry.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Choose a piece of beef with as little bone as you
can, the flank is most proper: sprinkle it, and let it
drain a day; then rub it with common salt, saltpetre,
and bay salt, but of the second a small proportion;
and you may add a few grains of cochineal,
all in fine powder. Rub the pickle every day
into the meat for a week, then only turn it.</p>

<p class='c010'>It will be excellent in eight days. In sixteen,
drain it from the pickle, and let it be smoked at
the oven mouth, where heated with wood, or send
to the baker’s. A few days will smoke it.</p>

<p class='c010'>A little of the coarsest sugar may be added to
the salt.</p>

<p class='c010'>It eats well boiled tender with greens or carrots.
If to be grated as Dutch, then cut a <i>lean</i> bit: boil
it till extremely tender; and while hot put it under
a press. When cold, fold it in a sheet of paper,
and it will keep in a dry place two or three
months.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>
  <h3 class='c013'><i>Pressed Beef.</i></h3>
</div>

<p class='c014'>Salt a bit of brisket, thin part of the flank, or the
tops of the ribs, with salt and saltpetre, five days;
then boil it gently till extremely tender. Put it
under a great weight, or in a cheese press, till perfectly
cold.</p>

<p class='c010'>It eats excellently cold, and for Sandwiches.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Hunter’s Beef.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>To a round of beef that weighs twenty five
pounds, take three ounces of saltpetre, three ounces
of coarsest sugar, an ounce of cloves, one nutmeg,
half an ounce of pimento, and three handfuls of
common salt, all in the finest powder.</p>

<p class='c010'>The beef should hang two or three days, then
rub the above well into it. Turn and rub it daily
for two or three weeks. The bone must be removed
at first. When to be dressed, dip it in cold
water to take off the loose spice: bind it up tight
with tape: put it into a pan, and a teacup of water
at bottom: put over the pan a brown crust and
paper, and bake it five or six hours. When cold,
remove the paste and fillet.</p>

<p class='c010'>The gravy is very fine, and a little of it adds
greatly to the flavor of any hash, soup, &#38;c.</p>

<p class='c010'>Both gravy and beef will keep some time. The
latter should be cut with a very sharp knife, and
quite smooth, to prevent waste.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Collared Beef.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Choose the thin end of the flank of fine mellow
beef, but not too fat. Lay it in a dish with salt, and
saltpetre. Turn and rub it every day for a week,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>and keep it cool. Then take out every bone and
gristle; remove the skin of the inside part, and
cover it thick with the following seasoning cut
small: a large handful of parsley, the same of sage,
some thyme, marjorum, pennyroyal, pepper, salt
and pimento. Roll the meat up as tight as possible,
and bind it; then boil it gently for seven or
eight hours. A cloth must be put round before
the tape. Put the beef under a good weight while
hot, without undoing it; the shape will then be
oval. Part of a breast of veal, rolled in with the
beef, looks and eats very well.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Beefsteak and Oyster Sauce.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Strain off the liquor from the oysters, and throw
them in cold water to take off the grit, while you
simmer the former with a bit of mace and lemonpeel;
then put the oysters in, stew them a few
minutes, and add a little cream if you have it, and
some butter, rubbed in a bit of flour; let them boil
up once, and have rump steaks, well seasoned and
broiled, ready for throwing the oyster sauce over
the moment you are to serve.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Staffordshire Beefsteaks.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Beat them a little with a rolling pin: flour and
season them; then fry with sliced onion to a fine
light brown. Lay the steaks in a stewpan, and pour
as much boiling water over as will serve for sauce:
stew them very gently half an hour, and add a
spoonful of catsup or walnut liquor before you
serve.</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>
  <h3 class='c013'><i>Italian Beefsteaks.</i></h3>
</div>

<p class='c014'>Cut a fine large steak from a rump that has been
well hung; or it will do from any <i>tender</i> part. Beat
it, and season with pepper, salt and onion. Lay it in
an iron stewpan, that has a cover to fit quite close;
set it at the side of a fire, without water. Take care
it does not burn, but it must have a strong heat.
In two or three hours it will be quite tender, then
serve with its own gravy.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Beef Collop.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Cut thin slices of beef from the rump or other
tender parts, and divide them in pieces three inches
long: beat with the blade of a knife, and flour
them. Fry the collops quick in butter two minutes;
then lay them in a small stewpan, and cover
with a pint of gravy: add a bit of butter rubbed
in flour, pepper, salt, the least bit of shalot shred
as fine as possible, half a walnut, four small pickled
cucumbers, and a teaspoonful of capers cut
small. Observe it does not boil; and serve the
stew in a very hot covered dish.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Beefsteak Pudding.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Prepare some fine steaks as above: roll them
with fat between, and if you approve <i>shred</i> onion,
add a very little. Lay a paste of suet in a bason,
and put in the rollers of steaks: cover the bason
with a paste, and pinch the edges to keep the gravy
in. Cover with a cloth tied close, and let the pudding
boil slowly, but for a length of time.</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>
  <h3 class='c013'><i>Beefsteak Pie.</i></h3>
</div>

<p class='c014'>Prepare the steaks as above, and when seasoned
and rolled with fat in each, put them in a dish, with
puff paste round the edges. Put a little water in
the dish, and cover it with a good crust.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Baked Beefsteak Pudding.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Make a batter of milk, two eggs, and flour, or
which is much better, potatoes boiled and mashed
through a colander. Lay a little of it at the bottom
of the dish, then put in the steaks prepared as
above, and very well seasoned; pour the remainder
of the batter over them, and bake it.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Podovies, or Beef Patties.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Shred raredone dressed beef, with a little fat:
season with pepper, salt, and a little shalot or onion.
Make a plain paste, roll it thin, and cut it in shape
like an apple puff; fill it with the mince, pinch the
edges, and fry them of a nice brown. The paste
should be made with a small quantity of butter,
egg, and milk.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Beef Palates.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Simmer them in water several hours, till they
will peel; then cut the palates in slices, or leave
them whole, as you choose, and stew them in a
rich gravy till as tender as possible. Before you
serve, season with Cayenne, salt, and catsup. If
the gravy was drawn clear, add to the above some
butter and flour.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Beef Cakes for side dish of dressed meat.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Pound some beef that is raredone, with a little
fat bacon or ham. Season with pepper, salt, and a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>little shalot or garlic: mix them well, and make
into small cakes three inches long, and half as wide
and thick: fry them a light brown, and serve them
in a good thick gravy.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Potted Beef.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Take two pounds of lean beef, rub it with saltpetre,
and let it lie one night; then salt with common
salt, and cover it with water four days in a
small pan. Dry it with a cloth, and season with
pepper: lay it into as small a pan as will hold it;
cover it with coarse paste, and bake it five hours in
a very cool oven. Put no liquor in.</p>

<p class='c010'>When cold, pick out the strings and fat; beat
the meat very fine with a quarter of a pound of
fine butter just warm, but not oiled, and as much
of the gravy as will make it into a paste. Put it into
very small pots, and cover them with melted
butter.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Another way.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Take beef that has been dressed, either boiled
or roasted: beat it in a mortar with some pepper,
salt, a few cloves, grated nutmeg, a little fine butter
just warm.</p>

<p class='c010'>This eats as well, but the colour is not so fine.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Hessian Soup and Ragout.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Clean the root of a tongue very nicely, and half
an ox head, with salt and water, and soak them afterwards
in plain water; then stew them in five or
six quarts of water till tolerably tender. Let the
soup stand to be cold: take off the cake of fat,
which will make good paste for hot meat pies, or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>serve to baste. Put to the soup a pint of split peas
or a quart of whole, twelve carrots, six turnips, six
potatoes, six large onions, a bunch of sweet herbs,
and two heads of celery. Simmer them without
the meat, till the vegetables are done enough to
pulp with the peas through a sieve, when the soup
will be about the consistence of cream. Season it
with pepper, salt, mace, pimento, a clove or two,
and a little Cayenne, all in the finest powder. If
the peas are bad, the soup may not be thick
enough; then boil in it a slice of roll, and put
through the colander; or put a little rice flour,
mixing it by degrees.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>The Ragout.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Cut the nicest part of the head in small thick pieces,
the kernels, and part of the fat of the root of
the tongue. Rub these with some of the same seasoning,
as you put them into a quart of the liquor,
kept out for that purpose before the vegetables
were added; flour well, and simmer them till nicely
tender. Then put a little mushroom and walnut
catsup, a little soy, and a glass of port wine, a
teaspoonful of made mustard, and boil all up together
before served.</p>

<p class='c010'>If for company, small eggs and forcemeat balls.</p>

<p class='c010'>This mode furnishes an excellent soup, and a ragout
at small expense, and they are uncommon.
The other part will warm for the family.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Stewed Oxcheek plain.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Soak and cleanse a fine cheek the day before you
would have it eaten. Put it into a stewpot that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>will cover close, with three quarts of water: simmer
it, after it has first boiled up and been well
skimmed. In two hours put plenty of carrots,
leeks, two or three turnips, a bunch of sweet herbs,
some whole pepper, and four Jamaica’s. Skim frequently.
When the meat is tender, take it out:
let the soup go cold: remove the cake of fat, and
serve it separate or with the meat.</p>

<p class='c010'>It should be of a fine brown, which may be done
by burnt sugar, or by frying some onions quite
brown with flour, and simmering them with it.
The latter improves the flavour of all soups and
gravies of the brown kind.</p>

<p class='c010'>If vegetables are not approved in the soup, they
may be taken out, and a small roll be toasted, or
bread fried and added. Celery is a great addition,
and should be always served. Where it is not to
be got, the seed gives an equally good flavour,
boiled in, and strained off.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>To dress an Oxcheek another way.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Soak half a head three hours, and clean it with
plenty of water. Take the meat off the bones; put
it into a pan with a large onion, a bunch of sweet
herbs, some bruised pimento, pepper, and salt.</p>

<p class='c010'>Lay the bones on the top: pour on two or three
quarts of water: cover the pan close with brown
paper, or a dish that will fit close. Let it stand
eight or ten hours in a slow oven, or simmer it by
the side of the fire, or on a hot hearth. When done
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>tender, let it go cold, having moved the meat into
a clean pan. Take the cake of fat off, and warm
the head in pieces in the soup. Put what vegetables
you choose.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Marrow Bones.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Cover the top with floured cloth: boil, and serve
with dry toast.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>To dress the Inside of a cold Sirloin of Beef.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Cut out all the meat, and a little fat, in pieces as
thick as your finger, and two inches long. Dredge
with flour, and fry in butter, of a nice brown.
Drain the butter from the meat, and toss up in a
rich gravy, seasoned with pepper, salt, anchovy,
and shalot. On no account let it boil. Before
you serve, add two spoonfuls of vinegar.</p>

<p class='c010'>Garnish with crimped parsley.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Fricassee of cold Roast Beef.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Cut the beef into very thin slices: shred a
handful of parsley very small: cut an onion in
quarters, and put all together into a stewpan, with
a piece of butter, and some strong broth. Season
with salt and pepper, and simmer very gently a
quarter of an hour; then mix into it the yelks of
two eggs, a glass of port wine, and a spoonful of
vinegar: stir it quick, and, rubbing the dish with
shalot, turn the fricassee into it.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>To dress Cold Beef that has not been done enough, called Beef Olives.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Cut slices half an inch thick, and four square:
lay on them a forcemeat of crumbs of bread, shalot,
a little suet or fat, pepper, and salt. Roll them,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>and fasten with a small skewer. Put them into a
stewpan, with some gravy made of the beef bones,
or the gravy of the meat, and a spoonful or two of
water, and stew them till tender. Fresh meat
will do.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>To dress ditto, called Sanders.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Mince small beef or mutton, onion, pepper, and
salt; add a little gravy: put into scallopshells or
saucers: make them three parts full; then fill
them up with potatoes, mashed with a little cream:
put a bit of butter on the top, and brown them in
an oven, or before the fire.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>To dress ditto, called Cecils.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Mince any kind of meat, crumbs of bread, a good
deal of onion, some anchovies, lemonpeel, salt, nutmeg,
chopped parsley, and pepper, and a bit of
butter warm, and mix these over a fire for a few
minutes. When cool enough, make them up into
balls of the size and shape of a turkey’s egg, with
an egg. Fry them, when sprinkled with fine
crumbs, of a yellow brown, and serve with gravy
as above.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Minced Beef.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Shred fine the underdone part, with some of the
fat. Put into a small stewpan, some onion, or
shalot, (a very little will do,) a little water, pepper,
and salt: boil till the onion be quite soft; then
put some of the gravy of the meat to it, and the
mince. Do not let it boil. Having a small hot
dish, with sippets of bread ready, pour the mince
into it; but first mix a large spoonful of vinegar
with it: or if shalot vinegar, there will be no need
of the onion, or raw shalot.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>
  <h3 class='c013'><i>Hashed Beef.</i></h3>
</div>

<p class='c014'>Do the same, only the meat is to be in slices;
and you may add a spoonful of walnut liquor or
catsup.</p>

<p class='c010'>Observe, that it is owing to boiling hashes or
minces, that they are hard. All sorts of stews, or
meat dressed second hand, should only be simmered;
and the latter only hot through.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>To preserve Suet a twelvemonth.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>As soon as it comes in, choose the firmest part,
and pick free from skin and veins. In a very nice
saucepan, set it at some distance from the fire,
that it may melt without frying, or it will taste.</p>

<p class='c010'>When melted, pour it into a pan of cold water.
When in a hard cake, wipe it very dry: fold it in
fine paper, and then in a linen bag, and keep in a
dry, but not hot place. When used, scrape it fine;
and it will make a fine crust, either with or without
butter.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Round of Beef</i>,</h3>

<p class='c014'>Should be carefully salted, and wet with the
pickle for eight or ten days. The bone should be
cut out first, and the beef skewered and filleted, to
make it quite round. It may be stuffed with parsley,
if approved; in which case, the holes to admit
it must be made with a sharp pointed knife, and
the parsley coarsely cut and stuffed in tight. As
soon as it boils, it should be skimmed, and afterwards
kept boiling very gently.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>To roast Tongue and Udder.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>After cleaning the tongue well, salt it with common
salt and saltpetre three days; then boil it, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>likewise a fine young udder, and some fat to it, till
tolerably tender; then tie the thick part of one to
the thin part of the other, and roast the tongue and
udder together.</p>

<p class='c010'>Serve them with a good gravy, and currantjelly
sauce. A few cloves should be stuck in the udder.</p>

<p class='c010'>This is an excellent dish.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>To pickle Tongues for boiling.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Cut off the root, leaving a little of the kernel and
fat. Sprinkle some salt, and let it drain from the
slime till next day: then, for each tongue, mix a
large spoonful of common salt, the same of coarse
sugar, and about half as much of saltpetre; rub it
well in, and do so every day. In a week add another
heaped spoonful of salt. If rubbed every day,
a tongue will be ready in a fortnight; but if only
turned in the pickle daily, it will keep four or five
weeks without being too salt.</p>

<p class='c010'>If you dry tongues, write the date on a parchment
and tie on. Smoke them, or plainly dry
them, if you like best.</p>

<p class='c010'>When to be dressed, boil it extremely tender:
allow five hours; and if done sooner, it is easily
kept hot. The longer kept after drying, the higher
it will be: if hard, it may require soaking three
or four hours.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Another way.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Clean as above. For two tongues, one ounce of
saltpetre, and one ounce of sal prunella. Rub them
well. In two days, having well rubbed them,
cover them with common salt. Turn them daily
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>for three weeks; then dry, rub in bran, and paper
or smoke them. In ten days they will be fit to eat
if not dried.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Beef Heart.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Wash with care. Stuff as you do hare, and
serve with rich gravy, and currantjelly sauce.</p>

<p class='c010'>Hash with the same, and port wine.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Tripe.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Tripe may be served in a tureen. Stewed with
milk and onion till tender. Melted butter for
sauce.</p>

<p class='c010'>Or, fried in small bits dipped in butter:  or stew
the thin part, cut in bits, in gravy, and thicken with
flour and butter, and add a little catsup: or fricasseed
with white sauce.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Bubble and Squeak.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Boil, chop, and fry, with a little butter, pepper,
and salt, some cabbage, and lay on it slices of raredone
beef, lightly fried.</p>

<p class='c010'>In both the following receipts, the roots must be
taken off the tongue before salted.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Stewed Tongue.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Salt a tongue with saltpetre and common salt for
a week, turning it daily. Boil it tender enough to
peel. When done, stew it in a moderately strong
gravy. Season with soy, mushroom catsup, Cayenne,
pounded cloves, and salt if necessary.</p>

<p class='c010'>Serve with truffles, morels, and mushrooms.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>An excellent mode of doing Tongues to eat cold.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Season with common salt and saltpetre, brown
sugar, a little bay salt, pepper, cloves, mace, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>pimento, in finest powder, for fourteen days: then
remove the pickle, put it in a small pan, and lay
some butter on it; cover with a brown crust, and
bake slowly till so tender that a straw would pierce it.</p>

<p class='c010'>The thin part of tongues, if hung up to become
dry, grate as hung beef; and likewise make a fine
addition to the flavour of omlets.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Leg of Veal.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Let the fillet be cut large or small, as best suits
the number of your company. The bone being taken
out, fill the space with a fine stuffing, and let it be
skewered quite round, and send the large side uppermost.
When half roasted, if not before, put a
paper over the fat, and observe to allow a sufficient
time, and to put it a good distance from the fire, the
meat being very solid. You may pot some of it.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Knuckle.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>As few people are fond of boiled veal, it may be
well to leave the knuckle small, and to take off
some cutlets or collops, before it be dressed; but
as the knuckle will keep longer than the fillet, it is
best not to cut off the slices till wanted. Break the
bones to make it take less room; and, washing it
well, put it into a saucepan with three onions, a
blade of mace or two, and a few peppercorns;
cover with water, and simmer it till thoroughly ready.
In the mean time some macaroni should be
boiled with it, if approved; or rice, or a little rice
flour, to give it a small degree of thickness; but
do not put too much. Before it be served, add half
a pint of milk and cream, and let it come up with
or without the meat.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>Or, fry the knuckle, with sliced onion and butter,
to a good brown, and have ready peas, lettuce, onion,
a cucumber or two, stewed in a small quantity
of water an hour, then add to the veal, and
stew till the meat be tender enough to eat, not to
be overdone. Throw in pepper, salt, and a bit of
shred mint, and serve altogether.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Cutlets Maintenon.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Cut slices about three quarters of an inch thick;
beat them with a rolling pin, and wet them on both
sides with egg: dip them into a seasoning of bread
crumbs, parsley, thyme, knotted marjorum, pepper,
salt, and a little nutmeg grated; then put
them in papers folded over, and broil them; and
have ready in a boat, melted butter, with a little
mushroom catsup.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Cutlets another way.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Prepare as above, and fry them. Lay them in a
dish, and keep them hot. Dredge a little flour,
and put a bit of butter into the pan, brown it; then
pour a little boiling water into it, and boil quick.
Season with pepper, salt, and catsup, and pour over
them.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Another way.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Prepare as before, and dress the cutlets in a
Dutch oven. Pour over them melted butter and
mushrooms. Or, pepper, salt, and broil, especially
neck steaks. They are excellent without herbs.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Collops dressed quick.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Cut them as thin as paper, with a very sharp
knife, and in small bits. Throw the skin, and any
<span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>odd bits of the veal into a little water, with a dust
of pepper and salt: set them on the fire while you
beat the collops, and dip them in a seasoning of
herbs, bread, pepper, salt, and a scrape of nutmeg,
having first wetted them in egg; then put a bit of
butter into a frying pan, and give the collops a very
quick fry; for as they are so thin, two minutes will
do them on both sides. Put them into a hot dish
before the fire, then strain and thicken the gravy.
Give a boil in the fryingpan, and pour over the
collops. A little catsup is an improvement.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Another way.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Fry them in butter, only seasoned with salt and
pepper: then simmer them in gravy, white or
brown, with bits of bacon served with them.</p>

<p class='c010'>If white, add lemonpeel and mace, and some
cream.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Veal Collops.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Cut long thin collops: beat them well, and lay
on them a bit of thin bacon the same size; and
spread forcemeat on that, seasoned high, with the
addition of a little garlick, and Cayenne. Roll
them up tight, about the size of two fingers, but
not more than two or three inches long. Put a
very small skewer to fasten each firm. Rub egg
over them, and fry of a fine brown, and pour over
them a rich brown gravy.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Scollops of cold Veal or Chicken.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Mince the meat extremely small, and set it over
the fire, with a scrape of nutmeg, a little pepper
and salt, and a little cream, for a few minutes;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>then put it into the scallopshells, and fill them with
crumbs of bread; over which put some bits of
butter, and brown them before the fire.</p>

<p class='c010'>Veal or chicken, as above prepared, served in a
dish, and lightly covered with crumbs of bread fried
(or they may be put on in little heaps), look and
eat well.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Scotch Collops.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Cut veal in thin bits, about three inches over, and
rather round: beat with a rolling pin: grate a little
nutmeg over them: dip in the yelk of an egg,
and fry them in a little butter, of a fine brown: pour
it from them; and have ready warm, to pour upon
them, half a pint of gravy, a little bit of butter rubbed
into a little flour, to which put a yelk of an
egg, two large spoonfuls of cream, and a bit of salt.
Do not boil the sauce, but stir it until of a fine
thickness to serve with the collops.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Kidney.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Chop veal kidney, and some of the fat, likewise
a little leek or onion, pepper, salt. Roll it up with
an egg into balls, and fry them.</p>

<p class='c010'>Cold fillet makes the finest potted veal; or you
may do it as follows:</p>

<p class='c010'>Season a large slice of the fillet before dressed,
with some mace, peppercorns, and two or three
cloves, and lay it close into a potting pan that will
but just hold it, and fill it up with water, and bake
it three hours. Then pound it quite small in a
mortar, and add salt to taste. Put a little gravy,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>that was baked, to it in pounding, if to be eaten
soon; otherwise only a little butter just melted.</p>

<p class='c010'>When done, cover it over with butter.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>To pot Veal or Chicken with Ham.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Pound some cold veal or white of chicken, seasoned
as above, and put layers of it with layers of
pounded ham, or rather shred: press each down,
and cover over with butter.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Neck of Veal.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Cut off the scrag to boil, and cover it with onion
sauce. It should be boiled in milk and water.
Parsley and butter may be served with it, instead
of the former sauce; or it may be stewed with
whole rice, small onions, and peppercorns, with a
very little water; or boiled and eaten with bacon
and greens.</p>

<p class='c010'>Best end, roasted, broiled as steaks, or made into
pies.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Breast of Veal.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Before roasted, if large, the two ends may be
taken off and fried to stew, or the whole may be
roasted. Butter should be poured over it.</p>

<p class='c010'>If any be left, cut the pieces in handsome sizes,
and putting them into a stewpan, pour some broth
over it; or if you have none, a little water will do.
Add a bunch of herbs, a blade or two of mace, some
pepper, and an anchovy. Stew till the meat is tender:
thicken with butter and flour, and add a little
catsup; or the whole breast may be stewed, after
cutting off the two ends.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>The sweetbread is to be served up whole in the
middle; and if you have a few mushrooms, truffles,
and morels, stew them with it, and serve.</p>

<p class='c010'>Boiled breast of veal, smothered with onion
sauce, is an excellent dish, if not old, or too fat.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Rolled Breast of Veal.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Bone it, and take off the thick skin and gristle,
and beat the meat with a rolling pin. Season with
herbs chopped very fine, mixed with salt, pepper,
and mace. Lay some thick slices of fine ham, or
roll into it two or three calves’ tongues of a fine
red, and boiled first an hour or two and skinned.
Bind it up tight in a cloth, and tape it. Set it over
the fire to simmer in a small quantity of water
until it be quite tender. Some hours will be necessary.</p>

<p class='c010'>Lay it on the dresser with a board and weight
on it till quite cold.</p>

<p class='c010'>Pigs’ or calves’ feet, boiled and taken from the
bones, may be put in or round it. The different
colours, laid in layers, look well when cut; and
yelks of eggs boiled may be put in, with beet root,
grated ham, and chopped parsley.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Shoulder of Veal.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Cut off the knuckle of the shoulder, for a stew
or gravy. Roast the other part, with stuffing. You
may lard it. Serve with melted butter.</p>

<p class='c010'>Clean it very nicely, and soak it in water, that it
may look very white. Take out the tongue to salt,
and the brains to make a little dish. Boil the head
extremely tender; then strew it over with crumbs
and chopped parsley, and brown them; or, if preferred,
leave one side plain.</p>

<p class='c010'>Bacon and greens are to be served to eat with it.</p>

<p class='c010'>The brains must be boiled, and then mixed with
melted butter, chopped scalded sage, pepper, and
salt.</p>

<p class='c010'>If any be left of the head, it may be hashed next
day, and a few slices of bacon just warmed and put
round.</p>

<p class='c010'>Cold calf’s head eats well.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Hashed Calf’s Head.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>When half boiled, cut off the meat in slices, half
an inch thick, and two or three inches long. Brown
some butter, flour, and sliced onion, and throw in
the slices with some good gravy, truffles, and
morels. Give it one boil, skim it well, and set it
in a moderate heat to simmer till very tender.</p>

<p class='c010'>Season with pepper, salt, and Cayenne, at first;
and ten minutes before serving, throw in some
shred parsley, and a very small bit of tarragon,
and knotted marjorum, cut as fine as possible. Just
before you serve, add the squeeze of a lemon.
Forcemeat balls and bits of bacon rolled round.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Mock Turtle.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Bespeak a calf’s head with the skin on: cut in
half, and clean it well; then half boil it. Have all
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>the meat taken off in square bits, and break the
bones of the head: boil them in some veal and beef
broth, to add to the richness. Fry some shalot
in butter: dredge in flour sufficient to thicken the
gravy, which stir into the browning, and give
it one or two boils: skim carefully, then put in the
head. Put in a pint of Madeira wine, and simmer
till the meat be quite tender. About ten
minutes before you serve, put in some basil,
tarragon, chives, parsley, Cayenne pepper, and
salt to your taste; and two spoonfuls of mushroom
catsup, and one of soy. Squeeze the juice of a
lemon into the tureen, and pour the soup upon it.
Forcemeat balls, and small eggs.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>A cheaper way.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Prepare half a calf’s head, without the skin, as
above. When the meat is cut off, break the bones,
and put into a saucepan, with some gravy made of
beef and veal bones, and seasoned with fried onions,
herbs, mace, and pepper. Have ready two or three
ox palates, boiled so tender as to blanch, and cut
in small pieces; to which a cowheel, likewise cut in
pieces, is a great improvement. Brown some butter,
flour, and onion, and pour the gravy to it; then
add the meats as above, and stew. Half a pint of
sherry wine, an anchovy, two spoonfuls of walnut
catsup, the same of mushroom, some chopped
herbs as before. Balls, &#38;c.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Forcemeat as for Turtle, at the Bush, Bristol.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>A pound of fine fresh suet, one ounce of ready
dressed veal or chicken, chopped fine, crumbs of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>bread, a little shalot or onion, salt, white pepper,
nutmeg, mace, pennyroyal, parsley, and lemon;
thyme finely shred: beat as many fresh eggs,
yelks  and whites separately, as will make the above
ingredients into a moist paste: roll into small balls,
and boil them in fresh lard, putting them in just as
it boils up. When of a light brown, take them out,
and drain them before the fire. If the suet be moist
or stale, a great many more eggs will be necessary.</p>

<p class='c010'>Balls made this way are remarkably light; but
being greasy, some people prefer them with less
suet and eggs.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Another Forcemeat, for Balls or Patties.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Pound cold veal or chicken: take out the strings:
add some fat bacon; and, if you like, the least portion
of scraped ham: herbs, as for the preceding:
pepper, salt, a little nutmeg, crumbs of bread, a
little onion, and two eggs.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Note.</i> When forcemeat is to be eaten cold, as in
pies, bacon is far better than suet, and the taste is
always higher.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Another Mock Turtle.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Put into a pan a knuckle of veal, two fine cowheels,
two onions, a few cloves, peppers, Jamaica
peppers, mace, and sweet herbs: cover with water,
and then, tying a thick paper over the pan, set it
in an oven for three hours. When cold, take off
the fat very nicely: cut the meat and feet into bits
an inch and half square: remove the bones and
coarser parts; then put the other on to warm, with
walnut and mushroom catsup, a large spoonful of
each, half a pint of sherry or Madeira wine, a little
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>mushroom powder, and the jelly of the meat.
When hot, if it want any more seasoning, add it,
and serve with hard eggs, forcemeat balls, a juice
of lemon, and a spoonful of soy.</p>

<p class='c010'>This is a very easy process, and the dish is excellent.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Another Ditto.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Stew a pound and a half of scrag of mutton, with
three pints of water to a quart; then set the broth
on, with a calf’s foot and a cowheel: cover the
stewpan tight, and simmer till you can cut off the
meat from the bones in proper bits. Set it on again,
with the broth, a quarter of a pint of  Madeira or
sherry wine, a large onion, half a teaspoonful of
Cayenne pepper, a bit of lemonpeel, two anchovies,
some sweet herbs, and eighteen oysters cut in
pieces, and then chopped fine, a teaspoonful of salt,
a little nutmeg, and the liquor of the oysters:
cover tight, and simmer three quarters of an hour.
Serve with forcemeat balls, and hard eggs in the
tureen.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Note.</i> Cowheels, with veal or head, are a great
improvement; and if not too much boiled, have a
very fine flavour stewed for turtle; and are more
solid than the calf’s feet.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Calf’s Head Pie.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Stew a knuckle of veal till fit for eating, with
two onions, a few isinglass shavings, a bunch of
herbs, 2 blade of mace, and a few peppercorns, in
two quarts or less of water. Keep the broth for
the pie. Take off a bit of the meat for the balls,
and let the other be eaten; but simmer the bones
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>in the broth till it is very good. Half boil the head,
and cut it in square bits: put a layer of ham at the
bottom, then some head, first fat then lean, with
balls and hard eggs cut in half, and so on till the
dish be full; but be particularly careful not to place
the pieces close, or the pie will be too solid, and
there will be no space for the jelly. The meat
must be first pretty well seasoned with pepper and
salt, and a scrape or two of nutmeg. Put a little water
and a little gravy into the dish, and cover it with a
tolerably thick crust: bake it in a slow oven; and
when done, pour into it as much gravy as it can
possibly hold, and do not cut it till perfectly cold:
in doing which, observe to use a very sharp knife,
and first cut out a large bit, going down to the bottom
of the dish; and when done thus, the different
colours, and the clear jelly, have a beautiful marbled
appearance.</p>

<p class='c010'>A small pie may be made to eat hot; which,
with high seasoning, oysters, mushrooms, truffles,
morels, &#38;c. has a very good appearance.</p>

<p class='c010'>The cold pie will keep some days. Slices make
a pretty side dish.</p>

<p class='c010'>The pickled tongues of former calves’ heads may
be cut in, to vary the colour, instead of, or besides
ham.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Calf’s Head Fricasseed.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Clean, and half boil half a head. Cut the meat
in small bits, and put into a tosser, with a little
gravy made of the bones, and some of the water it
was boiled in, a bunch of sweet herbs, an onion,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>and a blade of mace. If you have a sweetbread, or
young cockerels in the house, use the cockscombs;
having first boiled them tender and blanched. Season
the gravy with a little pepper, nutmeg, and salt:
rub down some flour and butter, and give all a boil
together; then remove the herbs and onion, and
add a little cup of cream, but do not boil it in. Serve
with small bits of bacon rolled round, and balls.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Veal Patties.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Mince some veal, that is not quite done, with a
little parsley, lemonpeel, a scrape of nutmeg, and
a little salt: add a little cream and gravy just to
moisten the meat; and if you have any ham, scrape
a little bit and add to it. Do not warm it till the
patties are baked; and observe to put a bit of bread
into each, to prevent the paste from rising into cake.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Fricandeau.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Cut a large piece out of the prime part of a leg
of veal, about nine inches long, and half as broad
and thick: beat it with a rolling pin; then lard it
very thickly on one side and the edges. Put it in
a small stewpan, with three pints of water, a pound
of veal cut in small bits, and four or five ounces of
lean ham, and an onion: simmer till the meat be
tender; then take it out; cover to keep it moist,
and boil the gravy till it be a fine brown, and much
reduced: then put the larded meat back into the
gravy, and pour a little of it over with a spoon.
When quite hot, serve the meat and gravy round
in the dish, with the following sauce in a boat.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Sorrel Sauce.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Wash a quantity of sorrel, and boil it tender in
the smallest quantity of water you can: strain and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>chop it: stew it with a little butter, pepper, and salt;
and if you like it high, add a spoonful of gravy.</p>

<p class='c010'>Be careful to do it in a very well tinned saucepan;
or if you have a silver one, or a silver mug,
it is far better; as the sorrel is very sour, especially
in spring.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Veal Olives.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Cut long thin collops: beat them, and lay on
them thin slices of fat bacon, and over a layer of
forcemeat seasoned high, with the addition of shred
shalot, and Cayenne. Roll them tight, about the
size of two fingers, but not more than two or three
inches long: fasten them round with a small skewer:
rub egg over, and fry them of a light brown.</p>

<p class='c010'>Serve with brown gravy.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Calf’s Liver.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Sliced: seasoned with pepper and salt, and nicely
broiled. Rub a bit of cold butter on it, and serve
hot and hot.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Roasted.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Wash and wipe it: then cut a long hole in it, and
stuff it with crumbs of bread, chopped anchovy,
herbs, a good deal of fat bacon, onion, salt, pepper,
a bit of butter, and an egg. Sew the liver up;
then lard or wrap it in a veal caul, and roast it.</p>

<p class='c010'>Serve with a good brown gravy, and currant jelly.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Sweetbreads.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Half boil, and stew in a white gravy. Add cream,
flour, butter, nutmeg, salt, and white pepper: or, in
brown, seasoned: or, after parboiling, cover with
crumbs, herbs, and seasoning, and brown in a Dutch
oven. Serve with butter, and mushroom catsup, or
gravy.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>
  <h3 class='c013'><i>Sweetbread Ragout.</i></h3>
</div>

<p class='c014'>Cut them about the size of a walnut: wash and
dry them; then fry of a fine brown. Pour to them
a good gravy, seasoned with salt, pepper, allspice,
mushrooms, or the catsup. Strain, and thicken
with butter, and a little flour. You may add truffles,
and morels, and the mushrooms.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Veal Sausages.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Chop equal quantities of lean veal and fat bacon,
a handful of sage, a little salt, pepper, and a few
anchovies. Beat all in a mortar; and, when used,
roll and fry it, and serve with fried sippets.</p>

<p class='c010'>Spadbury’s veal and pork sausages, under the
article of pork.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>To make excellent meat of a Hog’s Head.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Split the head, take out the brains, cut off the
ears, and sprinkle it with common salt for a day;
then drain. Salt it well with common salt and
saltpetre three days; then lay salt and head into
water (a small quantity) for two days. Wash it,
and boil it till all the bones will come out: remove
them, and chop the head as quick as possible;
having skinned the tongue, and taken the skin
carefully off the head, to put under and over. Season
with pepper, salt, a little mace or Jamaicas. Put
the skin into a small pan: press the cut head in,
and put the other skin over: press it down.
When cold, it will turn out and make a kind of
brawn. If too fat, you may put a few bits of lean
pork to go through the same process. Add salt
and vinegar, and boil with some of the liquor for a
pickle to keep it.</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>
  <h3 class='c013'><i>To scald a Sucking Pig.</i></h3>
</div>

<p class='c014'>The moment the pig is killed, put it into cold
water for a few minutes; then rub it over with a
little rosin, beaten extremely small, and put it into
a pail of scalding water half a minute; take it out,
lay it on a table, and pull off the hair as quickly as
possible. If any part does not come off, put it in
again. When perfectly clean, wash it well with
warm water, then in two or three cold waters, lest
any flavour of the rosin should remain. Take off
the four feet at the first joint: make a slit down
the belly, and take out the entrails: put the liver,
heart, and lights to the feet; wash the pig well in
cold water, dry it thoroughly, and fold it in a wet
cloth to keep it from the air.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>To roast a sucking Pig.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>If you can get it when just killed, it is of great
advantage. Let it be scalded, which those who sell
usually do. Then put some sage, crumbs of bread,
salt, and pepper in the belly, and sew it up. Observe
to skewer the legs back, or the under part
will not crisp.</p>

<p class='c010'>Lay it to a brisk fire till thoroughly dry; then
have ready some butter, in a dry cloth, and rub the
pig with it in every part. Dredge as much flour
over as will possibly lie, and touch it no more till
ready to serve; then scrape off the flour, with the
greatest care, with a blunt knife: rub it well with
the buttered cloth: take off the head while yet at
the fire, and take out the brains, and mix them
with the gravy that comes from the pig. Then
take it up, and, without withdrawing the spit, cut
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>it down the back and belly: lay it in the dish, and
chop the sage and bread quickly, as fine as you
can, and mix with a large quantity of fine melted
butter, which has very little flour. Put the sauce
into the dish after the pig has been split down the
back, and garnished with the two ears, and the two
<i>jaws</i>; the upper part of the head being taken off
down to the snout.</p>

<p class='c010'>In Devon, it is served whole if very small; the
head only being cut off.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Pettitoes.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Boil them, and the liver and heart, in a small
quantity of water very gently; then cut the meat
fine, and simmer it with a little of the water and
the feet split, till the latter be quite tender. Thicken
with a bit of butter, a little flour, a spoonful of
cream, a little salt, and pepper: give a boil up,
and pour over a few sippets of bread, and put the
feet on the mince.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Porker’s Head roasted.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Choose a fine young head, clean it well, and put
bread and sage as for pig: sew it up tight, and put
it on a string or hanging jack. Roast it as a pig,
and serve with the same sauce.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Pig’s Cheek for boiling.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Cut off the snout, and clean the head: divide it,
take out the eyes and the brains, and sprinkling the
head with salt, let it drain twenty four hours. Salt
it with common salt and saltpetre. Let it lie eight
or ten days, if to be dressed without stewing with
peas; but less, if to be dressed with peas; and it
must be washed first, and then simmered till all is
tender.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>
  <h3 class='c013'><i>Collared Head.</i></h3>
</div>

<p class='c014'>Scour the head and ears nicely: take off the hair
and snout, and take out the eyes and the brain:
lay it in water one night; then drain and salt it
extremely well with common salt and saltpetre, and
let it lie five days. Boil it enough to remove the
bones, then lay it on a dresser, turning the thick
end of one side of the head towards the thin end of
the other, to make the roll of equal size, sprinkle it
well with salt and white pepper, and roll it with the
ears; and if you approve, put the pig’s feet round
the outside when boned; or the thin parts of two
cowheels. Bind it in a cloth and with a broad tape,
and boil it till quite tender; then put a good weight
upon it, and do not remove the covering till cold.</p>

<p class='c010'>If you choose it to be more like brawn, salt it
longer, and let the proportion of saltpetre be greater,
putting in some pieces of lean pork, and then
cover it with cowheel, to look like the horn.</p>

<p class='c010'>This may be kept in or out of pickle of salt,
and water boiled, with vinegar; and is a very convenient
thing to have in the house.</p>

<p class='c014'>Choose a small leg of fine young pork, cut a slit
in the knuckle with a sharp knife, and fill the space
with sage and onion, chopped, and a little pepper
and salt. When half done, score the skin in slices,
but do not cut deeper than the outer rind.</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>
  <h3 class='c013'><i>To boil a Leg of Pork</i></h3>
</div>

<p class='c014'>Salt it eight or ten days; when to be dressed,
weigh it; let it lie half an hour in cold water to
make it white; allow a quarter of an hour for every
pound, and half an hour over from the time it boils
up; skim it as soon as it boils, and frequently after.
Allow water enough. Save some of it to make
pease soup. Some boil in a very nice cloth, floured,
which gives a very delicate look.</p>

<p class='c010'>Serve pease pudding and turnips.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Different ways of dressing Pig’s Feet and Ears.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Clean them carefully, and soak them some hours:
boil them tender, then take them out; and with
some of the water boil some vinegar and a little
salt, and when cold put over them. When to be
dressed, dry them, divide the feet in two, and slice
the ears; fry and serve them with butter, mustard,
and vinegar. They may be done in butter or only
floured.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Feet and Ears Fricasseed.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Put no vinegar in the pickle, if to be dressed
with cream. Cut the feet and ears into neat bits,
and boil them in a little milk; then pour that from
them, and simmer in a little veal broth, with a bit
of onion, mace and lemonpeel. Before you serve,
add a little cream, flour, butter, and salt.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Jelly of Feet and Ears.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Clean and prepare as in the foregoing receipt;
then boil in a very small quantity of water until
every bone can be taken out; throw in half a handful
of chopped sage, the same of parsley, a seasoning
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>of pepper, salt, and mace, in fine powder; simmer
till the herbs are scalded, then pour the whole
into a melon form.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Pork Steaks.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Cut them from a loin or neck, of middling thickness:
pepper and broil them, turning often. When
nearly done, put the salt necessary, rub a bit of
butter over, and serve the moment they are taken
off the fire; a few at a time.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>To cure Hams. First way.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Hang them a day or two; then sprinkle with a
little salt, and drain them another day. Pound an
ounce and a half of saltpetre, ditto petresalt, half an
ounce of sal prunel, and a pound of the coarsest
sugar: mix these well, and rub into each ham
every day for four days, and turn it. If a small
one, turn it every day for three weeks: if a large
one, a week longer; but do not rub after four days.
Before you dry it, drain and cover with bran.
Smoke it ten days.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Another way. Second way.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Choose a leg of a hog that is fat and well fed:
hang as above. To it, if large, put, in fine powder,
one pound of bay salt, four ounces saltpetre, one
pound of the coarsest sugar, and one handful of
common salt, and rub it thoroughly. Lay the rind
downwards, and cover the fleshy part with the salts.
Baste it as often as you can with the pickle; the
more the better. Keep it four weeks in the pickle,
turning it daily. Drain and throw bran over it;
then hang it in a chimney where wood is burnt, and
turn it sometimes for ten days.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>
  <h3 class='c013'><i>Another way. Third way.</i></h3>
</div>

<p class='c014'>Hang the ham and sprinkle with salt as above,
then rub it daily with the following in fine powder:
half a pound of salt, ditto bay salt, two ounces of saltpetre,
and two ounces of black pepper, mixed with
a pound and a half of treacle. Turn it twice a day
in the pickle, for three weeks. Lay it in a pail of
water for one night, wipe it quite dry, and smoke
it two or three weeks.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Another way, that gives a high flavour. Fourth way.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>When the weather will permit, hang the ham
three days: mix an ounce of saltpetre with one quarter
of a pound of bay salt, ditto common salt, ditto
of coarsest sugar, and a quart of strong beer; boil
them together, and pour over immediately on the
ham; turn it twice a day in the pickle for three
weeks. An ounce of black pepper, ditto of pimento,
in finest powder, added to the above, will give still
more flavour. Cover with bran when wiped, and
smoke from three to four weeks, as you approve;
the latter will make it harder, and more of the flavour
of Wesphalia. Sew hams in hessings, i.e.
coarse wrapper, if to be smoked where there is
strong fire.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>A method of giving a still higher flavour.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Sprinkle the ham with salt after it has hung two
or three days: let drain; make a pickle of a quart
of strong beer, half a pound of treacle, an ounce
of coriander seeds, two ounces of juniper berries,
an ounce of pepper, ditto pimento, an ounce of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>saltpetre, half an ounce of sal prunel, a handful of
common salt, and a head of shalot, all pounded or
cut fine. Boil these together a few minutes, and
pour over the ham: this quantity for one of ten
pounds. Rub and turn it every day, for a fortnight;
then sew it up in a thin linen bag, and smoke it
three weeks. Observe to drain it from the pickle,
and rub it in bran previous to drying.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Hogs’ Cheeks to dry.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>The snout being cut off, the brains removed, and
the head cleft, but not cut apart on the upper side,
rub it well with salt. Next day remove the brine,
and salt it again; the following day cover the head
with half an ounce of saltpetre, two ounces of bay
salt, a little common, and four ounces of coarsest
sugar. Let the head be often turned. In twelve
days smoke for a week like bacon.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>To dress Hams.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>If long hung, put the ham into water a night, and
either dig a hole in the earth, or let it lie on damp
stones, sprinkled with water to mellow, two or three
days, covering it with a heavy tub, to keep vermin
from it. Wash it well, and put it into a boiler with
plenty of water. Let it simmer four, five, or six
hours, according to the size. When sufficiently
done, if before the time of serving, cover it with a
clean cloth doubled, and keep the dish hot over
boiling water. Remove the skin, and strew raspings
over the ham. Garnish with carrot. Preserve the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>skin as whole as possible, to keep over the ham
when cold, which will prevent its drying.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>The manner of curing Wiltshire Bacon.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Sprinkle each flitch with salt, and let the blood
drain off for twenty four hours; then mix one
pound and a half of coarse sugar, ditto of bay salt,
not quite so much as half a pound of saltpetre, and
a pound of common salt, and rub it well on the
bacon, turning it every day for a month; then hang
it to dry, and afterwards smoke it ten days. The
above salts are for the whole hog.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>To pickle Pork.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>The quantities proportioned to the middlings of a
pretty large hog; the hams and shoulders being
cut off.</p>

<p class='c010'>Mix and pound fine four ounces of saltpetre, one
pound of coarse sugar, one ounce of sal prunel, and
a little common salt. Having sprinkled the pork
with salt, and drained it twenty four hours, rub it with
the above, and then pack the pieces light in a small
deep tub, filling up the spaces with common salt.
Place large pebbles on the pork, to prevent its
swimming in the pickle which the salt will produce.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Sausages.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Chop fat and lean of pork: season with sage,
pepper, and salt; and you may add two or three
pimentos. <i>Half fill</i> hog’s guts, that have been soaked
and made extremely clean: or the meat may be
kept in a very small pan, closely covered; and so
rolled and dusted with a very little flour before they
are fried.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>
  <h3 class='c013'><i>An excellent Sausage to eat cold.</i></h3>
</div>

<p class='c014'>Season fat and lean pork with some salt, saltpetre,
black and Jamaica pepper, all in finest powder,
and well rubbed into the meat. The sixth day
cut it small, and mix with it some shred shalot,
or garlick, as fine as possible. Have ready an ox
gut that has been scoured, salted, and soaked well,
and fill it with the above stuffing: tie up the ends,
and hang it to smoke as you would hams; but first
wrap it in a fold or two of old muslin. It must be
high dried. Some eat it without boiling, others
like it boiled first. The skin should be tied in
different places, making each link about eight
or nine inches long.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Spadbury’s Oxford Sausages.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Chop a pound and a half of pork, and the same
of veal, cleared of skins and sinews. Add three
quarters of a pound of beef suet, mince and mix
them. Steep the crumbs of a penny loaf in water,
and with a little dried sage, pepper, and salt, mix
with the meat.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Black Puddings.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>The blood must be stirred with salt till cold. Put
a quart of it, or rather more, to a quart of old
grits, to soak one night; and soak the crumbs of a
quartern loaf in rather more than two quarts of
new milk, made hot. In the mean time prepare
the guts, by washing and scraping with salt and
water, and changing the water several times.
Chop fine a little winter savory and thyme, a great
deal of pennyroyal, pepper, salt, a few cloves, allspice,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>ginger, and nutmeg. Mix these with three
pounds of beefsuet, and six eggs well beaten and
strained, and then beat the bread, grits, &#38;c. all up
with the seasoning. When well mixed, have ready
some hogs fat cut in large bits, and as you fill the
skins put it in at proper distances. Tie them in links,
having only half filled them, and boil them in a
large kettle, pricking them as they swell, or they
will burst. When boiled, lay them between clean
cloths till cold, and hang them up in the kitchen.
When to be used, scald them a few minutes in
water, wipe and put them in a Dutch oven.</p>

<p class='c010'>If there are not sufficient skins, put the stuffing
in basons, and boil, covered with floured cloths;
and slice and fry it when used.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Black Puddings another way.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Soak a quart of bruised grits in two quarts of hot
milk, or less, if sufficient to swell them. Chop a
good quantity of pennyroyal, some savory and
thyme; salt, pepper, and Jamaica pepper, finely
powdered. Mix the above with a quart of the
blood, prepared as before: then half fill the skins,
after they have been cleaned most thoroughly, and
put as much of the leaf, i. e. fat of the pig, as shall
make it pretty rich. Boil as before directed.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>White Hogs’ Puddings.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>When the skins have been soaked and cleaned
as before directed, rinse and soak them all night in
rosewater, and put into them the following filling;
mix half a pound of blanched almonds, cut in seven
or eight bits, with one pound of grated bread, two
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>pounds of marrow or suet, one pound of currents,
some beaten cinnamon, cloves, mace, and nutmeg,
a quart of cream, yelks of six, and whites of two
eggs, a little orange flour water, a little fine Lisbon
sugar, some lemon peel, and citron sliced, and
half fill the skins. Boil as before directed.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Hogs’ Lard.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Should be carefully melted in a jar, put into a
kettle of water, and boiled and run into bladders
that have been extremely well cleaned. The smaller
they are, the better the lard keeps; as after the
air reaches it, it becomes rank. Put in a sprig of
rosemary when melted.</p>

<p class='c010'>This being a most useful article for frying fish,
it should be prepared with care. Mixed with butter
it makes fine crust.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Pig’s Harslet.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Wash and dry some liver, sweetbreads, and fat
and lean bits of pork; beating the latter with a
rolling pin to make it tender. Season with pepper,
salt, sage, and a little onion, shred fine. Put all
when mixed into a cawl, and fasten it up tight with
a needle and thread. Roast it on a hanging jack,
or by a string. Or serve in slices with parsley for
a fry.</p>

<p class='c010'>Serve with a sauce of port and water, and mustard
just boiled up, and put into the dish.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Loins and Necks of Pork, roast.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Shoulders and breasts put into pickle, or salt the
former as a leg.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>
  <h3 class='c013'><i>Rolled Neck.</i></h3>
</div>

<p class='c014'>Bone it. Put a forcemeat of chopped sage, a very
few crumbs of bread, salt, pepper, and two or three
pimentos over the inside: then roll the meat as
tight as you can, and roast it slowly, and at a good
distance at first.</p>

<p class='c004'><i>To make a Pickle for Hams, Tongues, or Beef, if boiled
and skimmed between each parcel of them, that
will keep for years.</i></p>

<p class='c010'>To two gallons of spring water put two pounds
of coarse sugar, two pounds of bay, and two and a
half pounds of common salt, and half a pound of
saltpetre, in a deep earthen glazed pan, that will
hold four gallons, and has a cover that will fit close.
Keep the beef or hams as long as they will bear,
before you put them into the pickle, and sprinkle
them with coarse sugar in a pan, from which they
must drain. Rub the hams, &#38;c. well with the
pickle, and pack them in close, putting as much
as the pan will hold, so that the pickle may cover
them. The pickle is not to be boiled at first.
A small ham may lie fourteen days, a large one
three weeks; a tongue twelve days; beef in proportion
to its size. They will eat well out of the
pickle without drying. When to be dried, let each
piece be drained over the pan, and when it will drop
no longer, take a clean sponge and dry it thoroughly.
Six or eight hours will smoke them; and
there should be only a little sawdust and wet straw
burnt to smoke them; but if put into a baker’s
chimney, sew them in coarse cloth, and hang
them a week.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>
  <h3 class='c013'><i>Excellent Bacon.</i></h3>
</div>

<p class='c014'>When the hog is divided, if a large one, the
chine should be cut out. The bacon will be preserved
from being rusty, if the spareribs are left in.
Salt the bacon six days; then drain it from the
first pickle. Mix as much salt as you judge proper
with eight ounces of bay salt, four ounces of
saltpetre, and one pound of coarse sugar, to each
hog, the hams being first cut off. Rub the salts
well in, and turn it every day for a month. Drain,
and smoke a few days; or dry without, by hanging
in the kitchen, not near the fire.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Mutton.</span> <i>The Haunch.</i></p>

<p class='c010'>Keep as long as it can be preserved sweet, by the
different modes of keeping. Let it be washed with
warm milk and water, or vinegar, if necessary; but
soak off the flavour from keeping. Put a coarse
paste on strong paper, and fold the haunch in: set
it at a great distance from the fire, and allow proportionable
time for the paste, which do not remove
till about thirty five or forty minutes before serving;
then baste it perpetually. You will have brought
the haunch nearer to the fire before you take off
the paste, and must froth it up as you would venison.</p>

<p class='c010'>A gravy must be made of a pound and a half of
loin of old mutton, simmered in a pint of water to
half, and no seasoning but salt. Brown it with a
little burnt sugar, and send it up in the dish: but
there should be much gravy in the meat; for
though long at the fire, the distance and covering
will prevent its being done dry.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>Serve with currantjelly sauce.</p>

<p class='c010'>Legs roasted, and onion or currantjelly sauce:
or, boiled, with caper sauce and vegetables.</p>

<p class='c010'>Necks are particularly useful, as so many dishes
may be made of them; but they are not advantageous
for the family. The bones should be cut
short; which the butchers will not do unless particularly
desired.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Note.</i> When there is more fat to a neck or loin
of mutton than is agreeable to eat with the lean, it
makes an uncommonly good suet pudding, or crust
for a meatpie, being cut very fine.</p>

<p class='c010'>The best end of the neck boiled, and served with
turnips: or roasted: or in steaks, in pies, or harrico.</p>

<p class='c010'>The scrag stewed in broth, or with a small quantity
of water, some small onions, a few peppercorns
and a little rice, and served together.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Harrico.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Take off some of the fat, and cut the middle or
best end of the neck into rather thin steaks. Put
the fat into a fryingpan, and, flouring, fry them in
it of a fine light brown, but not enough for eating.
Put them in a dish while you fry the carrots, turnips,
and onions; the former in dice, the latter sliced;
but they must only be warmed, not browned, or you
need not fry them. Then lay the steaks at the
bottom of a stewpan, the vegetables over, and pour
as much boiling water on them as will just cover:
give one boil, skim well, and then set the pan on
the side of the fire to simmer gently till tender: in
three or four hours skim, and add pepper, salt, and
one spoonful of catsup.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>
  <h3 class='c013'><i>Mutton Pie.</i></h3>
</div>

<p class='c014'>Cut steaks from a loin or neck of mutton: beat
them and remove some of the fat. Season with
salt, pepper, and a little onion. Put a little water
at the bottom of the dish, and a little paste on the
edge; then cover with a moderately thick paste. Or
raise small pies, and, breaking each bone in two to
shorten it, season and cover it over, pinching the
edge. When they come out, pour a spoonful of
gravy, made of a bit of mutton, into each. The
mutton should have hung.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Mutton and Potatoe Pie.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Season the steaks of a loin or neck; lay them in a
dish: have ready potatoes mashed very thick, with
some milk, and a bit of butter and salt, and cover
the meat as with a very thick crust, and to come
on the surrounding edge.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Mutton Pudding.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Season as above. Lay one layer of steaks at the
bottom of the dish, and pour a batter of potatoes
boiled and pressed through a colander, and mixed
with milk and an egg, over them: then putting the
rest of the steaks, and batter, bake it.</p>

<p class='c010'>Batter with flour, instead of potatoes, eats well,
but requires more egg, and is not so good.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Mutton Sausages.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Take a pound of the rawest part of a leg of mutton
that has been either roasted or boiled: chop it
extremely small: season with pepper, salt, mace,
and nutmeg. Add six ounces of beef suet, some
sweet herbs, two anchovies, and a pint of oysters,
all chopped very small; a quarter of a pound of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>grated bread, some of the anchovy liquor, and all
that came from the oysters; the yelks and whites
of two eggs well beaten. Put it all, when well mixed,
into a little pot, and use it by rolling it into balls
or sausage shape, and fry them. If approved, a
<i>little</i> shalot may be added; or garlick, which is a
great improvement.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Mutton Steaks</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Should be cut from a loin or neck that has hung.
If the latter, the bones should not be long. They
should be broiled on a clear fire, and seasoned when
half done, and frequently turned; when, taking into
a very hot dish, rub a bit of butter on each, and
serve hot and hot the moment they are done.</p>

<p class='c010'>They may be covered with forcemeat.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Mutton Collops.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Cut from that part of a well hung loin of mutton
which is next the leg, some collops very thin.
Take out the sinews. Season them with salt, pepper
and mace, and strew over them shred parsley,
thyme, and two or three shalots. Fry them in butter
till half done. Add half a pint of gravy, a little
juice of lemon, and a piece of butter rubbed in flour,
and simmer the whole very gently five minutes.
They should be served immediately, or they will
be hard.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Lamb Steaks.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Fry a beautiful brown. Throw over them, when

the meat up tight with a fillet. Stew it in a small
quantity of water, with an onion, and a few peppercorns,
till quite tender.</p>

<p class='c010'>Have ready a little good gravy, and some oysters
stewed in it: thicken with flour and butter, and

<p class='c014'>Hang the mutton, to be tender. Bone it, and lay
a seasoning of pepper, pimento, mace, nutmeg, a
few cloves, all in fine powder, over it. Next day
prepare a stuffing as for a hare, beat the meat, and
cover it with the stuffing, roll it tight, and fillet it.
Half bake it in a slow oven: let it grow cold: remove
the fat, and put the gravy into a stewpan:
flour the meat, and put in likewise; stew till near
ready, and add a glass of port wine, some catsup,
an anchovy, and a little lemon pickle, half an hour
before serving, which do in the gravy, and with
jelly sauce. A few fresh mushrooms are a great
improvement, but not if to eat like hare, nor add
the lemon pickle.</p>

salt, two ounces of saltpetre, half a pound of
coarsest sugar, all in powder: mix and make it
quite hot; then rub it well into the ham, let it be
turned in the liquor daily. At the end of four

<p class='c015'>Make a stuffing of bread, herbs, salt, pepper, nutmeg,
lemonpeel, a few oysters or an anchovy, a bit
of butter, some suet, and an egg. Put this in the
crop, and fasten up the skin, and boil the turkey in
a floured cloth, to make it very white. Have ready
a fine oyster sauce, made rich with butter, a
little cream, a spoonful of soy, if approved, and
pour over the bird. Or, liver and lemon sauce.</p>

<p class='c010'>Hen birds are best for boiling, and should be
young.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Turkey to Roast.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>The sinews of the legs should be drawn, whichever
way it be dressed. The head should be twisted
under the wing; and in drawing, care should
be taken not to tear the liver, or let the gall touch
it. Put a stuffing of sausage meat; or, if sausages
<span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>are to be served in the dish, a bread stuffing. As
this makes a large addition to the size of the bird,
observe that the heat of the fire be constantly to
that part; for the breast is frequently not enough
done. A little strip of paper should be put on the
bone to prevent scorching, while the other parts
roast. Baste well, and froth it up. Gravy in the
dish, and plenty of bread sauce in a sauce tureen.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Pulled Turkey.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Divide the meat of the breast by pulling instead
of cutting; then warm it in a spoonful or two of
white gravy, a little cream, grated nutmeg, salt,
and a little flour and butter: warm, but do not boil
it. The leg seasoned, scored, and broiled, put in
the dish, with the above round it. Cold chicken

  <h3 class='c013'><i>To boil Fowl with Rice.</i></h3>
</div>

<p class='c014'>Stew the fowl very slowly, in some clear mutton broth,
well skimmed, and seasoned with onion,
mace, pepper, and salt. About half an hour before
it be ready, put in a quarter of a pint of rice, well
washed and soaked. Simmer till tender; then
strain from the broth, and put the rice on a sieve
before the fire. Keep the fowl hot; lay it in the
middle of the dish, and the rice round it, without
the <i>broth</i>; which will be very nice to eat as such;
but the less liquor it is done with the better.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Fricassee of Chickens.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Boil them rather more than half in a small
quantity of water: let them cool; then cut them
up, and put them to simmer in a little gravy, made
of the liquor they were boiled in, and a bit of veal
or mutton, onion, mace, lemonpeel, white pepper,
and a bunch of sweet herbs. When quite tender,
keep them hot while you thicken the sauce thus:
strain off, and put it back into the saucepan, with
a little salt, a scrape of nutmeg, a bit of flour and
butter: give it one boil; and when you are going
to serve, beat up the yelk of an egg, add half a pint
of cream, and stir them over the fire, but do not
let it boil.</p>

<p class='c010'>It will be equally good without the egg.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Another white Sauce, more easily made.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Take a little of the water that boiled the fowls,
(which must be kept hot) and stew with it some
cut onion, a bit of parsley, a blade of mace, and a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>bit of lemonpeel. Mix with this a bit of butter,
flour, and little thick cream, and adding the chicken,
warm it with the sauce.</p>

<p class='c010'>The above for veal or rabbit; but if either are
not sufficiently done before, then the cream and
flour should be added just before serving, after the
meat is a little stewed.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Davenport Fowls.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Hang young fowls a night: take the livers,
hearts, and tenderest parts of the gizzards, shred
very small, with half a handful of young clary, an anchovy
to each fowl, one onion, and the yelks of four
eggs, boiled hard, with pepper, salt, and mace to
your taste. Stuff the fowls with this, and sew up
the vents and necks quite close, that the water may
not get in. Boil them in salt and water till near
done; then drain, and put them into a stewpan,
with butter enough to brown them. Then serve
with fine melted butter, and a spoonful of catsup,
of either sort, in the dish.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>To pull Chicken.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Take off the skin, and pull the flesh off the bones
of a cold fowl, in as large pieces as you can.
Dredge with flour, and fry of a nice brown in butter;
which drain from it, and simmer in a good
gravy, well seasoned, and thickened with a little
flour and butter. Add the juice of half a lemon.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Chicken Pie.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Cut up two young fowls: season with white
pepper, salt, a little mace, and nutmeg, all in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>finest powder; likewise a little Cayenne. Put the
chicken, slices of ham or gammon, forcemeat, and
hard eggs, alternately. If to be in a dish, put a
little water; if in a raised crust, none. Against
the pie be baked, have ready a gravy of knuckle of
veal, with a few shank bones, seasoned with herbs,
onion, mace, and pepper. If in a dish, put in as
much gravy as will fill it: if in crust, let it go cold;
then open the lid, and put in the jelly.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>The Forcemeat for Pies of Fowls of any kind.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Pound fine, cold chicken, or veal, a bit of fat bacon,
some grated ham, crumbs of bread, a very
little bit of onion, parsley, knotted marjorum, and
a very small bit of tarragon, chopped fine; a blade
of mace, a little nutmeg, white pepper, and salt, in
finest powder. When well mixed, add eggs to
make into balls.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Chicken Curry.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Cut up the chickens before they are dressed,
and fry them in butter, with sliced onions, till of a
fine colour: or if you use those that have been
dressed, do not fry them: lay the joints, cut in two
or three pieces each, into a stewpan, with veal or
mutton gravy, a clove or two of garlick, four large
spoonfuls of cream, and some Cayenne: rub
smooth one or two spoonfuls of curry powder, with
a little flour, and a bit of butter, and add twenty
minutes before you serve; stewing it on till ready.
A little juice of lemon should be squeezed in when
serving.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>Slices of rare done veal, rabbit, or turkey, make
a good curry.</p>

<p class='c010'>A dish of rice boiled plain, as hereafter directed,
must be always served to eat with curry.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Another Curry, and more quickly made.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Cut up a chicken or young rabbit; if the former,
take off the skin, and rub each piece in a large
spoonful of flour, mixed with half an ounce of curry
powder: slice two or three onions, and fry in
butter, of a fine light brown; then add the meat,
and fry altogether, until the latter begin to brown;
then put into a stewpan, and pour boiling water
over to cover. Let it simmer very gently two or
three hours until quite tender. If too thick, put
more water half an hour before it be served.</p>

<p class='c010'>Dressed fowl or meat may be done; but the
curry will be better made of fresh.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Grouse.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Are to be roasted like fowls; but their heads
twisted under the wing, and served with gravy, and
bread sauce, or with sauce for wild fowl. See
Sauces.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>To pot Grouse, or Moor Game.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Pick, singe, and wash them very clean; then rub
them inside and out with a high seasoning of salt,
pepper, mace, nutmeg, and allspice. Lay them in
as small a pot as will hold them: cover them with
butter, and bake them in a slow oven. When cold,
take off the butter, move the birds from the gravy,
dry, and put them into pots that will just fit one or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>two; the former, where there are not many. Melt
the former butter with some more, so as to completely
cover the birds: but take care not to oil it.
Do not let it be too hot.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>To roast Widgeon, Duck, Teal, or Moorhen.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>The flavour is best preserved without stuffing;
but put some pepper, salt, and a bit of butter in the
birds. Wild fowl require to be much less done
than tame, and to be served of a fine colour.</p>

<p class='c010'>The basting ordered in the foregoing receipt
takes off a fishy taste which wild fowl sometimes
have. Send up a very good gravy in the dish; and
on cutting the breast, half a lemon squeezed over,
with pepper on it, improves the taste.</p>

<p class='c010'>Or stuff them with crumbs, a little shred onion,
sage, pepper, and salt, but not a large quantity,
and add a bit of butter. Slice an onion, and put into
the dripping pan, with a little salt, and baste the
fowls with it till three parts done; then remove
that, and baste with butter. They should come up
finely frothed, and not be overdone.</p>

<p class='c010'>An excellent sauce under that article.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Duck to boil.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Choose a fine fat duck, salt it two days, then boil
it slowly, and cover it with onion sauce made very
white, and the butter melted with milk instead of
water.</p>

<p class='c010'>To roast duck: stuff or not, and serve with gravy.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Duck Pie.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Bone a full grown young duck, and a fine young
fowl of a good size. Season them both well with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>mace, pepper, salt and allspice. Put the fowl within
the duck, and a calf’s tongue that has been
pickled red, and boiled, within the fowl. Make
the whole to lie close. The skin of the legs and
wings should be drawn inwards, that the body may
lie smooth, Put the birds into a raised pie, or
small piedish, and cover it with a thickish paste.
Bake in a slow oven to eat cold.</p>

<p class='c010'>The old Staffordshire raised pies were made as
above, but a turkey was put over the duck, and a
goose over that, forming a very large pie.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Goose to Roast.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>After being carefully picked, the plugs of the
feathers pulled out, and the hairs singed, let it be
well washed, dried, and seasoned with onion, sage,
pepper, and salt; fasten it tight at the neck and
vent, and roast it.</p>

<p class='c010'>When half done, let a narrow strip of paper be
skewered on the breastbone. Baste it well, and
observe to take it up the moment it is done, nicely
frothed. When the breast rises, take off the paper,
and observe to serve it before it fall, or it will be
spoiled, and come to table flattened. Before it is
cut up, cut the apron off, and pour in a wineglass
of port wine and a teaspoonful of mustard. Cut
the breast from one pinion to the other, if for a
large party, without leaving meat to the wingbone.</p>

<p class='c010'>Gravy, and apple sauce.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>
  <h3 class='c013'><i>Green Goose Pie.</i></h3>
</div>

<p class='c014'>Bone two green geese, having first removed
every plug, and singed them nicely. Wash them
clean; season high with salt, mace, pepper, and
pimento: put one within the other, and press them
close into your piedish; put a good deal of butter
over them, and bake with or without a crust: if
the latter, a cover that will keep the steam in,
must supply the place of a crust. It will keep long.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Giblet Pie.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Stew duck or goose giblets, when nicely cleaned,
with onion, black pepper, and a bunch of sweet
herbs, till tender. Let them become cold; then
put them in the dish with two or three steaks of
veal, beef, or mutton, especially if there are not
giblets enough to make the sized pie that you
wish. A little cup of cream, put in when baked, is
a great improvement. Put the liquor in first.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Stewed Giblets.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>As above, and add a little butter and flour. Serve
with sippets, and cream just scalded in the sauce.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Stewed Pigeons.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Let them be fresh, and carefully cropped,
drawn, and washed, then let them soak half an
hour: in the mean time cut a hard white cabbage
into water in slices as for pickling; drain it,
and boil it in milk and water; drain it again,
then lay some of it at the bottom of a stewpan;
put the birds on it, being well seasoned, and cover
them with the remainder; put a little broth into
them, and stew till quite tender, before you serve.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>Add some cream, and a little flour and butter;
give it one boil, and serve the cabbage round the
pigeons.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Another way.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Stew in a good gravy, stuffed or not, and season
well. Add a little mushroom catsup, or fresh
mushrooms.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>To pickle Pigeons.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Bone the pigeons, turn the inside out, and lard
it: season with Jamaica pepper pounded very fine,
and a little salt: turn the inside outward again,
and tie the neck and rump with thread: put them
in boiling water, let them boil a minute or two to
plump; take them out, and dry with a cloth. The
pickle must be made of an equal quantity of wine,
and white wine vinegar; white pepper, Jamaica
pepper, sliced nutmeg, ginger, and two or three
bayleaves boiled. When it boils, put the pigeons
into it, and let them boil fifteen minutes, if small;
twenty, if large. Then take them out, wipe, and
let them cool. When the pickle is cold, take off
the fat, and put them in.</p>

<p class='c010'>They must be kept in a stonejar, tied down
with a bladder to exclude the air. You may in
some, instead of larding, put a stuffing of hard yelks
of eggs, and marrow, in equal quantities, spices,
and sweet herbs.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Pigeons in Jelly.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Save some of the liquor in which a knuckle of
veal has been boiled, as likewise a calf’s foot, or else
<span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>simmer some isinglass in it, a blade of mace, an
onion, a bunch of herbs, some lemonpeel, white
pepper, and salt. When the pigeons are nicely
cleaned and soaked, put them in a pan, and pour
the liquor over them; and let them be baked, and
remain in it till cold. When served, put jelly over
and round them. Season them as you approve.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Potted Pigeons.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Take fresh ones: clean them carefully: season
with pepper and salt: put them close in a small pan,
and pour butter over: bake, and when cold take
them out. Put into fresh pots, fit to serve to table,
two or three in each, and pour butter over, using
that which was baked with them as part. Observe,
that it is necessary to put a good deal of butter if
to be kept.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Note.</i> Butter that has covered potted things is
good for basting, and will make very good paste
for meatpies. If to be high, add some mace, and
a few Jamaica peppers to the seasoning.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c006'><i>Pigeon Pie.</i></h2>
</div>
<p class='c015'>Clean as before: season; and, if approved, put
some parsley into the birds, and a bit of butter, with
pepper and salt. Lay a beefsteak at the bottom of
the dish, and hard eggs between each two birds,
and a little water. If you have ham in the house,
lay a slice on each: it is a great improvement to
the flavour.</p>

<p class='c010'>Observe, when you cut ham for sauce or pies,
to turn it, and take from the underside instead of
the prime.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>
  <h3 class='c013'><i>Broiled Pigeons.</i></h3>
</div>

<p class='c014'>Slit them down the back: season, and broil.
Serve with mushroom sauce; or melted butter,
with a little mushroom catsup.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Roast Pigeons.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Should be stuffed with uncut parsley, seasoned;
and served with parsley and butter. Asparagus,
or peas, should be dressed to eat with them.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Parsley Pie.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Lay veal or fowl at the bottom of a pie dish,
seasoned. Take a colander full of picked parsley,
cover the meat with it, and pour some cream into
the dish, and a spoonful or two of broth. Cover
with crust.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Potatoe Pasty.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Boil, peel, and mash potatoes as fine as possible;
then mix pepper, salt, and a little thick cream,
or, if you prefer it, butter. Make a paste, and,
rolling it out like a large puff, put the potatoe into
it, and bake it.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Turnip Pie.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Season mutton chops with pepper and salt: lay
them in the bottom of a dish, reserving the ends of
the bones to lay over the turnips; which cut and
season, and lay over the steaks till the dish be full.
Put two or three spoonfuls of water in, and cover
with crust. You may add a little onion.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Shrimp Pie. Excellent.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Take a quart of picked shrimps: if very salt,
only season with mace, and a clove or two in fine
powder; but if not salt, mince two or three anchovies,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>mix with the spice, and season them. Put
some butter at the bottom of the dish, and over
the shrimps, and a glass of sharp white wine. Put
a good light paste over. They do not require long
baking.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Cornish Pies.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Scald and blanch some broad beans: cut mushrooms,
carrots, turnips, and artichoke bottoms, and
with some peas, and a little onion, make the whole
into a nice stew, with some good veal gravy. Bake
a crust over a dish, with a little lining round the
edge, and a cup within to keep it from sinking:
open the lid, and put in the fricassee made hot;
seasoning to your taste. Shalots, parsley, lettuce,
celery, or any sort of vegetables that you like, may
be added.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Fish Pie.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Put slices of cod that have been salted a night;
pepper, and between each layer put a good quantity
of parsley picked from the stalks, and some
fresh butter. Pour a little broth, if you have any,
or else a little water. Bake the pie; and when to
be served, add a quarter of a pint of raw cream
warm, with half a teaspoonful of flour. Oysters
may be added.</p>

<p class='c010'>Mackerel will do well; but do not salt it till used.</p>

<p class='c010'>Soals, with oysters, seasoned with pounded mace,
nutmeg, pepper, an anchovy, and some salt, make
an excellent pie. Put in the oyster liquor, two or
three spoonfuls of broth, and some butter, for
gravy. When come from the oven, pour in a cup
of thick cream.</p>

  <h3 class='c013'><i>To prepare Meat or Fowls for raised Pies.</i></h3>
</div>

<p class='c014'>When washed, put a good seasoning of spices
and salt. Set it over a fire in a stewpan, that will
just hold the meat: put a piece of butter, and,
covering close, let it simmer in its own steam till
it shrink. It must be cool before it be put into the
pie. Chicken’s sweetbreads, giblets, pigeon’s meat,
almost any thing will make a good pie, if well
seasoned, and made tender by stewing. A forcemeat
may be put under and over, of cold chicken
or veal, fat bacon, shred ham, herbs, bread, and
seasoning, bound with an egg or two, or in balls.
Or instead of crust, use an earthen pie form.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Hares</i>,</h3>

<p class='c014'>If old, should be larded with bacon, after having
hung as long as they will keep, and being first
soaked in pepper and vinegar.</p>

<p class='c010'>If not paunched as soon as killed, hares are more
juicy: but as that is usually done in the field, the
cook must be careful to wipe it dry every day; the
liver being removed, and boiled to keep for the
stuffing.</p>

<p class='c010'>Parsley put into the belly will help keep it fresh.</p>

<p class='c010'>When to be dressed, the hare must be well
soaked; and if the neck and shoulders are bloody,
in warm water: then dry it, and put to it a large
fine stuffing, made of the liver, an anchovy, some
fat bacon, a little suet, herbs, spice, and bread
crumbs, with an egg to bind it. Sew it up. Observe
that the ears are nicely cleaned and singed.
When half roasted, cut the skin off the neck to let
<span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>out the blood, which afterwards fixes there. Baste
with milk till three parts done, then with butter:
and before served, froth it up with flour. It should
be put down early, kept at a great distance at first
from the fire, and drawn nearer by degrees.</p>

<p class='c010'>Send a rich brown gravy in the dish; melted
butter in one boat, and currantjelly in another.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>To jug an old Hare.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>After it is well cleaned and skinned, cut it up
and season it with pepper, allspice, salt, pounded,
mace, and a little nutmeg: put it into a jar, with an
onion, a clove or two, a bunch of sweet herbs, and
over all a bit of coarse beef. Tie it down with a
bladder and leather quite close, and put the jar into
a saucepan of water up to its neck, but no higher.
Let the water boil gently five hours. When to be

cream, and boil with the soup: pour it on a roll in
the tureen; but it should have soaked a little first
in the soup, which should be as thick as middling
cream.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Old Peas Soup.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Save the water of boiled pork or beef: if too salt,
use only a part, and the other of plain water: or put
some roast beef bones, or a ham or bacon bone to
give a relish; or an anchovy or two. Set these on
with some good whole or split peas, the smaller
quantity of water at first the better: simmer till the
peas will pulp through a colander; then set that,
and some more of the liquor, besides what boiled
the peas, some carrots, turnips, celery, and onion,
or a leak or two, to stew till all be tender. Celery
will take less time, and may be put in an hour before
dinner. When ready, put fried bread in dice,
dried mint rubbed small, pepper, and, if wanted,
salt, in the tureen, and pour the soup upon them.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Green Peas Soup.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>In shelling, divide the old from the young, and
put the former, with a bit of butter, and a little water
into a stewpan, and the old parts of lettuce, an
onion or two, a little pepper and salt. Simmer till
the peas will pulp through a colander; which when
<span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>done, add to it some more water, and that which
boiled the peas, the best parts of the lettuce, and
the young peas, a handful of spinach cut small,
pepper, and salt to taste. Stew till the vegetables
are quite tender; and a few minutes before serving,
throw in some green mint, cut fine.</p>

<p class='c010'>Should the soup be too thin, a spoonful of rice flour,
rubbed down with a bit of butter, and boiled
with it, will give it consistence.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Note.</i> If soup or gravy be too weak, the cover
of the saucepan should be taken off, and the steam
let out, boiling it very quick.</p>

<p class='c010'>When there is plenty of vegetables, green peas
soup needs no meat: but if approved, a pig’s foot,
or a small bit of any sort, may be boiled with the
old peas, and removed into the second process till
the juices shall be obtained. Observe, three or
four ounces of butter, will supply richness to a soup
without meat, or make it higher with it.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Gravy Soup.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Wash a leg of beef, break the bone, and set it
over the fire with five quarts of water, a large
bunch of herbs, two onions, sliced and fried, but not
burnt, a blade or two of mace, three cloves, twenty
Jamaica peppers, and forty black. Simmer till the
soup be as rich as you choose; then strain off the
meat, which will be fit for the servants’ table. Next
day take off the cake of fat, and that will warm
with vegetables; or make a piecrust for the same.
Have ready such vegetables as you choose to serve,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>cut in dice, carrot, and turnip, sliced, and simmer
till tender. Celery should be stewed in it likewise;
and before you serve, boil some vermicelli long
enough to be tender, which it will be in fifteen minutes.
Add a spoonful of soy, and one of mushroom
catsup. Some people do not serve the vegetables,
only boil for the flavour. A small roll should be
made hot, and kept long enough in the saucepan to
swell, and then be sent up in the tureen.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>A rich White Soup.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Boil in a small quantity of water a knuckle of
Veal, and scrag of mutton, mace, white pepper, two
or three onions, and sweet herbs, the day before
you want the soup. Next day take off the fat, and
put the jelly into a saucepan, with a quarter of a
pound of sweet almonds blanched, and beaten to a
paste in a mortar with a little water to prevent
oiling, and put to it apiece of stale white bread, or
crumb of a roll; a bit of cold veal, or white of chicken.
Beat these all to a paste with the almond paste, and
boil it a few minutes with a pint of raw thick cream,
a bit of fresh lemonpeel, and half a blade of mace
pounded; then add this thickening to the soup.
Let it boil up and strain it into the tureen: if not
salt enough, then put it in. If macaroni or vermicelli
be served, they should be boiled in the soup,
and the thickening be strained after being mixed
with a part. A small rasped roll may be put in.</p>

<p class='c010'>Instead of the cream thickening, as above,
ground rice, and a little cream may be used.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>
  <h3 class='c013'><i>A plainer White Soup.</i></h3>
</div>

<p class='c014'>Of a small knuckle of veal, two or three pints of
soup may be made, with seasoning as before, and
both served together, with the addition of a quarter
of a pint of good milk.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>An excellent Soup.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>A scrag or knuckle of veal, slices of undressed
gammon, onions, mace, and a small quantity of
water, simmered till very strong, and lower it with
a good beef broth made the day before, and stewed
until the meat is done to rags. Add cream, vermicelli,
almonds as before, and a roll.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Carrot Soup.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Put some beef bones, with four quarts of the
liquor in which a leg of mutton or beef has been
boiled, two large onions, one turnip, pepper and salt,
into a saucepan, and stew for three hours. Have
ready six large carrots, cut thin after they are
scraped; strain the soup on them, and stew till
soft enough to pulp through a hair sieve or coarse
cloth: then boil the pulp with the soup; which is
to be as thick as pea ssoup. Use two wooden spoons
to rub the carrots through. Make the soup the day
before it is to be used. Add Cayenne.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Onion Soup.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>To the water that has boiled a leg or neck of
mutton, put carrots, turnips, and, if you have one,
a shankbone, and simmer till the juices are obtained.
Strain it on six onions previously sliced, and
fried a light brown; with which simmer it three
hours. Skim it carefully, and serve it. Put into it
a little roll or fried bread.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>
  <h3 class='c013'><i>Vegetable Soup.</i></h3>
</div>

<p class='c014'>Pare and slice five or six cucumbers, the inside
of as many cos lettuces, a sprig or two of mint, two
or three onions, some pepper and salt, a pint and
half of young peas, and a little parsley. Put these,
with half a pound of fresh butter, into a saucepan to
stew in their own liquor near a gentle fire half an
hour; then pour two quarts of boiling water to the
vegetables, and stew them two hours: rub down a
little flour into a teacup of water; boil it with the
rest fifteen or twenty minutes, and serve it.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Another Vegetable Soup.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Peel and slice six large onions, six potatoes, six
carrots, and four turnips: fry them in half a pound
of butter: pour on them four quarts of boiling water,
and toast a crust of bread as brown and hard as possible,
but do not burn it: put that, some celery,
sweet herbs, white pepper and salt, to the above:
stew gently four hours, strain through a coarse
cloth: have ready sliced carrot, celery, and a little
turnip, and add to your liking; and stew them tender
in the soup. If approved, you may add an
anchovy, and a spoonful of catsup.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Spinach Soup.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Shred two handfuls of spinach, a turnip, two
onions, a head of celery, two carrots, and a little
thyme and parsley. Put all into a stewpot, with,
a bit of butter the size of a walnut, and a pint of
broth, or the water in which meat has been boiled;
stew till the vegetables are quite tender: work
them through a coarse cloth or sieve with a spoon;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>then with the pulp of the vegetables, and liquor, a
quart of fresh water, pepper and salt, boil all
together. Have ready some suet dumplings, the
size of a walnut, and before you put the soup
into the tureen, put them into it. The suet must
not be shred too fine; and take care that it is perfectly
fresh.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Scotch Leek Soup.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Put the boiling of a leg of mutton into a stew pot,
with a quantity of chopped leeks, and pepper and
salt; simmer them an hour, then mix some oatmeal
with a little cold water quite smooth, pour it
into the soup, and setting it on a slow part of the
fire, let it simmer gently; but take care that it does
not burn to the bottom.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Hare Soup.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Take an old hare that is good for nothing else
than soup, cut in pieces, and put it with a pound
and a half of lean beef, two or three shankbones
of mutton well cleaned, a slice of lean bacon or
ham; an onion, and a bunch of sweet herbs: pour
on it two quarts of boiling water: cover the jar, in
which you put these, with bladder and paper, and
set it in a kettle of water: simmer till the hare is
stewed to pieces: strain off the liquor, and give it
one boil, with an anchovy cut in pieces, and add a
spoonful of soy, and a little Cayenne and salt. A
few fine forcemeat balls, fried of a good brown,
should be served in the tureen.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>
  <h3 class='c013'><i>Scotch Mutton Broth.</i></h3>
</div>

<p class='c014'>Soak a neck of mutton in water for an hour: cut
off the scrag, and put into a stewpot with two
quarts of water: as soon as it boils, skim it well
and simmer it an hour and a half; then take the
best end of the mutton, cut it into pieces, two bones
in each, and put as many as you think proper, having
cut off some of the fat. Skim it the moment
the fresh meat boils up, and every quarter of an
hour. Have ready four or five carrots, the same
of turnips, and three onions, all cut, but not
small, and put in time enough to be quite tender;
two large spoonfuls of Scotch barley, first wetted
with cold water. The meat should stew three
hours. Salt to taste, and serve all together. Twenty
minutes before serving, put in some chopped
parsley.</p>

<p class='c010'>It is an excellent winter dish.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Soups under the articles of their respective Meats.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Oxcheek Soup. Hessian Soup. Mock turtle,
page <a href='#Page_49'>49</a> to 52.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Ox rump Soup.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Two or three rumps of beef, will make it stronger
than a much larger proportion of meat without;
and form a very nourishing soup.</p>

<p class='c010'>Make it like gravy soup, and give it what flavour
or thickening you like.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Soup A-la-sap.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Boil half a pound of grated potatoes, one pound
of beef sliced thin, one pint of grey peas, one onion,
and three ounces of rice, in six pints of water to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>five; strain it through a colander, then pulp the
peas to it, and turn it into a saucepan again, with
two heads of celery sliced: stew it tender, adding
pepper and salt; and when you serve, fried bread.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Crawfish or Prawn Soup.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Boil six whitings, and a large eel; or the latter,
and half a thornback, being well cleaned, with as
much water as will cover them. Skim clean, and
put in whole pepper, mace, ginger, parsley, an
onion, a little thyme, and three cloves. Boil to a
mash. Pick fifty crawfish, or a hundred prawns,
pound the shells, and a little roll, after having boiled
them with a little water, vinegar, salt and herbs.
Pour this liquor over the shells in a sieve, then
pour the other soup, clear from the sediment; chop
a lobster, and add to it, with a quart of good beef
gravy. Add the tails of the crawfish or the prawns,
and some flour and butter; and season as necessary.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Portable Soup. A very useful thing.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Boil one or two knuckles of veal, one or two
shins of beef, and a pound or more of fine juicy
beef, in as much water only as will cover them.
When the bones are cracked, out of which take
the marrow, put any sort of spice you like, and
three large onions. When the meat is done to
rags, strain it off, and put in a <i>very</i> cold place.
When cold, take off the cake of fat (which will
make crust for servants’ pies), put the soup into a
double bottom tin saucepan, set it on a pretty quick
fire, but do not let it burn. It must boil fast, and uncovered,
and be stirred constantly for eight hours;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>Put into a pan, and let it stand in a cold place a day;
then pour it into a round soup China dish, and set
the dish into a stewpan of boiling water on a stove,
and let it boil, and be occasionally stirred, till the
soup become thick and ropy; then it is enough.
Pour it into the little round part at the bottom of
cups or basons to form cakes; and when cold, turn
them out on flannel to dry, and wrap them in it.
Keep them in tin canisters. When to be used,
melt in boiling water: and if you wish the flavour
of herbs or any thing else, boil it first, and having
strained the water, melt the soup in it.</p>

<p class='c010'>This is very convenient for a bason of soup or
gravy in the country, or at sea, where fresh meat
is not always at hand.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c006'><i>Clear Gravy.</i></h2>
</div>
<p class='c015'>Slice beef thin: broil a part of it, over a very
clear quick fire, just enough to give colour to the
gravy, but not to dress it: put that, and the raw
into a very nicely tinned stewpan, with two onions,
a clove, or two Jamaica and black peppers, and a
bunch of sweet herbs: cover it with hot water; give
it one boil, and skim it well two or three times:
then cover it and simmer till quite strong.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>To draw Gravy that will keep a week.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Cut thin lean beef: put it in a fryingpan without
any butter: set it on a fire covered, but take care
it does not burn: let it stay till all the gravy that
comes out of the meat be dried up into it again;
then put as much water as will cover the meat,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>and let that stew away. Then put to the meat a
small quantity of water, herbs, onions, spice, a bit
of lean ham: simmer till it is rich, then keep it in
a cool place. Remove the fat only when going to
be used.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>A rich Gravy.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Cut beef in thin slices, according to the quantity
wanted: slice onions thin, and flour both: fry
them of a light pale brown, but on no account suffer<a id='t103'></a>
them to go black: put them into a stewpan, and
pouring boiling water on the browning in the fryingpan,
boil it up, and pour on the meat. Put to
it a bunch of parsley, thyme, savory, and a small
bit of knotted marjorum, and the same of tarragon,
some mace, Jamaica and black peppers, a clove or
two, and a bit of ham or gammon. Simmer till
you have all the juices of the meat; and be sure to
skim the moment it boils, and frequently after. If
for a hare, or stewed fish, anchovy should be added.</p>

<p class='c010'>The shankbones of mutton are a great improvement
to the richness of the gravy; being first well
soaked, and scoured clean.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Note.</i> Jelly gravy for cold pies should be brown
or white, as the meat or fowl is. It must be drawn
without frying, relished, and made quite clean, by
running it through a flannel bag. To give it the
consistence of jelly, shanks, or knuckle, or feet,
should be boiled with the bones.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Jelly to cover cold Fish.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Clean a maid: put it with three quarts of water,
an ounce and a half of isinglass, a bit of mace,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>lemonpeel, white peppers, a stick of horseradish,
and a little ham or gammon. Stew, till on trying
with a spoon you find that it jellies: then strain it
off, and add to it the whites of five eggs, a glass of
sherry wine, and the juice of a lemon; give it another
boil, and pour it through a jellybag till quite
transparent.</p>

<p class='c010'>When cold, lay it over the fish with a spoon.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Cullis, or brown Sauce.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Lay as much lean veal over the bottom of a stewpan
as will cover it an inch thick: then cover the
veal with thin slices of undressed gammon, two or
three onions, two or three bayleaves, some sweet
herbs, two blades of mace, and three cloves. Cover
the stewpan, and set it over a slow fire. When the
juices come out, let the fire be a little quicker.
When the meat is of a fine brown, fill the pan with
good beef broth, boil and skim it, then simmer an
hour: add a little water, mixed with as much flour
as will make it properly thick; boil it half an hour,
and strain it.</p>

<p class='c010'>This will keep a week.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Veal Gravy.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Make as directed for the cullis, leaving out the
spice, herbs, and flour. It should be drawn very
slowly: and if for white dishes, do not let the meat
brown.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Bechamel or White Sauce.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Cut lean veal in small slices, and the same quantity
of lean bacon or ham: put them in a stewpan,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>with a good piece of butter, an onion, a blade of
mace, a few mushroom buttons, a bit of thyme, and
a bayleaf. Fry the whole over a very slow fire,
but not to brown it: add flour to thicken; then
put an equal quantity of good broth, and rich cream.
Let it boil half an hour, stirring it all the time:
strain it through a soup strainer.</p>

<p class='c010'>N. B. Soups and gravies are far better by putting
the meat at the bottom of the pan, and stewing it,
and the herbs, roots, &#38;c. with butter, than by adding
the water to the meat at first; and the gravy
that is drawn from the meat, should be nearly
dried up before the water is put to it. Do not use
the sediment of gravies, &#38;c. that have stood to be
cold. When onions are strong, boil a turnip with
them, if for sauce, which will make them mild.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Sauce for Wild Fowl.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Simmer ten minutes a teacupful of port wine,
the same of good meat gravy, a little shalot, a little
pepper, salt, a grate of nutmeg, and a bit of mace:
put a bit of butter and flour: give one boil, and
pour through the birds; which in general are not
stuffed as tame, but may be done so, if liked.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Another for the same, or Ducks.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Serve a rich gravy in the dish: cut the breast in
slices, but do not take them off; cut a lemon, and
put pepper and salt on it; then squeeze it on the
breast, and pour a spoonful of gravy over before
you help.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span><i>Note.</i> In cutting up any wild fowl, duck, goose,
or turkey for a large party, if you cut the slices
down from pinion to pinion, without making wings,
there will be more prime pieces.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Sauce Robart for Rumps or Steaks.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Put into a saucepan a piece of butter the size of
an egg: set it over the fire, and when browning,
throw in a handful of sliced onions cut small: fry
them brown, but do not let them burn: add half a
spoonful of flour, shake the onions in it, give another
fry, then put four spoonfuls of gravy, pepper, and
salt, and boil gently ten minutes. Skim off the fat:
add a teaspoonful of made mustard, a spoonful of
vinegar, and half a lemon juice: boil, and pour
round the steaks, which should be of a fine yellow
brown, and garnished with fried parsley and lemon.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>An Excellent Sauce for Carp or boiled Turkey.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Rub half a pound of butter with a teaspoonful of
flour; put to it a <i>little</i> water, melt it, and add near a
quarter of a pint of thick cream, and half an anchovy
chopped fine, unwashed; set it over the fire, and
as it boils up, add a large spoonful of real India soy.
If that does not give it a fine colour, put a little
more. Turn it into the sauce tureen, and put some
salt, and half a lemon. Stir it well to prevent curdling.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Sauce for cold Fowl or Partridge.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Rub down in a mortar the yelks of two eggs boiled
hard, an anchovy, two dessert spoonfuls of oil, a

piece of butter, in the proportion of a teaspoonful
to a full quarter of a pound; then put into a saucepan,
and pour on it two large spoonfuls of hot water;
set it on the fire, and let it boil quick. You

<p class='c014'>Pound the spawn, and two anchovies: pour on
two spoonfuls of gravy: strain it into some butter
melted as above; then put in the meat of the lobster,
give one boil, and add a squeeze of lemon.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Another way.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Leave out the anchovies and gravy, and do as

<p class='c014'>Chop one or two without washing: put to some
flour and butter, and a little drop of water: stir it
over the fire till it boil once or twice. When the
anchovies are good, they will be dissolved; and the
colour will be better than by the usual way.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Fish Sauce without Butter.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Simmer very gently a quarter of a pint of vinegar,
half a pint of water (which must not be hard)
with an onion, half a handful of horseradish, and
the following spices lightly bruised: four cloves,
two blades of mace, and half a teaspoonful of black
pepper. When the onion is quite tender, chop it
small with two anchovies: and set the whole on
the fire to boil for a few minutes, with a spoonful
of catsup. Mean time, have ready and well beaten
the yelks of three fresh eggs: strain; mix in the
liquor by degrees with them; and when well mixed,
set the saucepan over a gentle fire, keeping a
bason in one hand, into which toss the sauce to and
fro, shaking the saucepan over the fire, that the
eggs may not curdle. Do not boil, only let the
sauce be hot enough to give the thickness of melted
butter.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Lemon Sauce.</i></h3>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Buttered Eggs.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Beat four or five eggs, yelk and white together:
put a quarter of a pound of butter in a bason and
then put that in boiling water; stir it till melted:
then pour that butter and the eggs into a saucepan.
Keep a bason in your hand: just hold the saucepan
in the other over a slow part of the fire, shaking
it one way; as it begins to warm, pour it
into a bason, and back; then hold it again over
the fire, stirring it constantly in the saucepan, and
pouring it into the bason, more perfectly to mix
the egg and butter, until they shall be hot without
boiling.</p>

<p class='c010'>Serve on toasted bread; or in a bason to eat with
salt fish or red herrings.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Onion Sauce.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Peel, and boil onions tender: squeeze the water
from them; then chop, and add butter that has
<span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>been melted rich and smooth as before, but with a
little good milk instead of water: boil up once, and
serve for boiled rabbits, partridges, scrag, or knuckle
of veal; or roast mutton.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Oyster Sauce.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Save the liquor in opening, and boil with the
beards, a bit of mace, and lemonpeel. Mean time
throw the oysters into cold water, and drain it off.
Strain the liquor, and put it into a saucepan with
them, and as much butter, mixed with a little milk,
as will make sauce enough; a little flour being
previously rubbed with it.</p>

<p class='c010'>Set them over the fire, stir all the time; and
when the butter has boiled once or twice, take
them off, and keep the saucepan near, but not on
the fire; for if done too much, the oysters will be
hard. Squeeze a little lemonjuice, and serve.</p>

<p class='c010'>If for company, a little cream is a great improvement.
Observe the oysters will thin the sauce, and
put butter accordingly.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Bread Sauce.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Boil a large onion, cut in four, with some black
peppers, and milk, until the former be quite a pap.
Pour the milk strained on grated white stale bread,
and cover it. In an hour put it into a saucepan,
with a good piece of butter, mixed with a little
flour: boil the whole up together, and serve.</p>

<p class='c010'>Some people like the bread pulped through a
colander before the butter be added. A large
spoonful of cream improves it.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>
  <h3 class='c013'><i>Little Eggs for Pies or Turtles.</i></h3>
</div>

<p class='c014'>Boil three eggs hard: beat the yelks fine with
the raw yelk of an egg; then make up the paste
into small eggs, and throw them into a little boiling
water to harden.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Fish Sauce A-la-Craster.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Thicken a quarter of a pound of butter with
flour, and brown it; then put to it a pound of the
best anchovies, cut small, six blades of pounded
mace, ten cloves, forty black and Jamaica peppers,
a few small onions, a faggot of sweet herbs; namely,
savory, thyme, basil, and knotted marjorum; a
little parsley, and sliced horseradish. On these
pour half a pint of the best sherry wine, and a pint
and a half of strong gravy: simmer all gently for
twenty minutes; then strain it through a sieve,
and bottle it for use: the way of which, is to boil
some of it in the butter, as melting.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>A very fine Fish Sauce.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Put into a very nice tin saucepan, a pint of fine
port wine, one gill of mountain, half a pint of walnut
catsup that is fine, twelve anchovies, and the
liquor that belongs to them, one gill of walnut pickle,
the rind and juice of a large lemon, four or
five shalots, Cayenne to taste, three ounces of
scraped horseradish, three blades of mace, and two
teaspoonfuls of made mustard: boil gently, till the
rawness go off, then put it in small bottles for use.</p>

<p class='c010'>Cork very close, and seal the top.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>
  <h2 class='c006'><i>Camp Vinegar.</i></h2>
</div>
<p class='c015'>Slice a large head of garlick, and put it into a
widemouthed bottle, with half an ounce of Cayenne,
two teaspoonfuls of real soy, two of walnut catsup,
four anchovies chopped, a pint of vinegar, of cochineal
enough to give the colour of lavender drops.
Let it stand six weeks, then strain off quite clear,
and keep in small bottles, sealed up.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Lemon Pickle.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Wipe six lemons: cut each into eight pieces: put
on them a pound of salt, six large cloves of garlick,
two ounces of horseradish, sliced thin; likewise of
cloves, mace, nutmeg, and Cayenne, a quarter of
an ounce each, and two ounces of flour of mustard;
to these put two quarts of vinegar: boil a quarter
of an hour in a well tinned saucepan, or which is
better, do it in a strong jar, in a kettle of boiling
water, or set the jar on the hot hearth till done.
Set the jar by, and stir it daily for six weeks. Keep
the jar close covered. Put into small bottles.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Shalot Vinegar.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Split six or eight shalots: put them into a quart
bottle: fill it up with vinegar: stop it; and in a
month it will be fit for use.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Essence of Anchovies.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Take a dozen of anchovies, chop them, and without
the bone, but with some of their own liquor
strained: add them to sixteen large spoonfuls of
water: boil gently till dissolved, which will be in
a few minutes. When cold, strain and bottle it.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>
  <h3 class='c013'><i>Mushroom Catsup.</i></h3>
</div>

<p class='c014'>Take the largest broad mushrooms, break them
into an earthen pan, strew salt over, and stir them
now and then for three days. Then let them stand
for twelve, till there is a thick scum over. Strain,
and boil the liquor with Jamaica and black peppers,
mace, ginger, a clove or two, and some mustardseed.
When cold, bottle it, and tie a bladder over
the cork. In three months boil it again with some
fresh spice, and it will then keep a twelvemonth.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Mushroom Catsup, another way.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Take a stewpan full of the large flap mushrooms,
that are not wormeaten, and the skins and fringe of
those you have picked; throw a handful of salt
among them, and set them by a slow fire. They
will produce a great deal of liquor, which you must
strain; and put to it four ounces of shalots, two
cloves of garlick, a good deal of pepper, ginger,
mace, cloves, and a few bayleaves. Boil and skim
very well. When cold, cork close. In two months
boil it up again, with a little fresh spice, and a
stick of horseradish, and it will then keep the year;
which mushroom catsup rarely does, if not boiled
a second time.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Walnut Catsup of the finest sort.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Boil a gallon of the expressed juice of walnuts
when they are tender, and skim it well: then put
in two pounds of anchovies, bones and liquor, ditto
of shalots, one ounce of cloves, ditto of mace, ditto
of pepper, and one clove of garlick. Let all simmer
till the shalots sink; then put the liquor into
<span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>a pan till cold. Bottle, and divide the spice to each.
Cork closely, and tie a bladder over.</p>

<p class='c010'>It will keep twenty years, and is not good the
first. Be very careful to express the juice at home;
for it is rarely unadulterated, if bought.</p>

<p class='c010'>Some people make liquor of the outside shell
when the nut is ripe; but neither the flavour nor
colour is then so fine.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Cockle Catsup.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Open the cockles: scald them in their own liquor:
add a little water when the liquor settles, if
you have not enough: strain through a cloth, then
season with every savory spice; and if for brown
sauce, add port wine, anchovies, and garlick; if for
white, omit these, and put a glass of sherry wine,
lemonjuice and peel, mace, nutmeg, and white
pepper. If for brown, burn a bit of sugar for colouring.</p>

<p class='c010'>It is better to have cockles enough, than to add
water; and they are cheap.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Mushroom Powder.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Wash half a peck of large mushrooms while
quite fresh, and free them from grit and dirt with
flannel. Scrape out the black part clean, and do
not use any that are wormeaten: put them into a
stewpan over the fire without water, with two large
onions, some cloves, a quarter of an ounce of mace,
and two spoonfuls of white pepper, all in powder.
Simmer and shake them till all the liquor be dried
up, but be careful they do not burn. Lay them on
tins or sieves in a slow oven, till they are dry
<span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>enough to beat to powder; then put the powder
in small bottles, corked and tied closely, and keep
in a dry place.</p>

<p class='c010'>A teaspoonful will give a very fine flavour to
any soup or gravy, or any sauce; and it is to be added
just before serving, and one boil given to it after
it is put in.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>To dry Mushrooms.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Wipe them clean; and of the large take out the
brown, and peel off the skin. Lay them on paper
to dry in a cool oven, and keep them in paper bags
in a dry place. When used, simmer them in the
gravy, and they will swell to near their former
size. To simmer them in their own liquor till it
dry up into them, shaking the pan, then drying on
tin plates, is a good way, with spice or not, as above,
before made into powder.</p>

<p class='c010'>Tie down with bladder, and keep in a dry place,
or in paper.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Sugar Vinegar.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>To every gallon of water, put two pounds of the
very coarsest sugar: boil and skim thoroughly;
then put one quart of cold water for every gallon of
hot. When <i>cool</i>, put into it a toast spread with yeast.
Stir it nine days; then barrel, and set it in a place
where the sun will lie on it, with a bit of slate on the
bunghole.</p>

<p class='c010'>When sufficiently sour, it may be bottled: or
may be used from the cask, with a wooden spigot
and faucet.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>
  <h3 class='c013'><i>Gooseberry Vinegar.</i></h3>
</div>

<p class='c014'>Boil spring water; and when cold, put to every
three quarts, a quart of bruised ripe gooseberries in
a large tub. Let them remain sixty hours, stirring
often: then strain through a hair bag, and to each
gallon of liquor add a pound of the coarsest sugar.
Put it into a barrel, and a toast and yeast, cover the
bunghole with a bit of slate, &#38;c. as above. The
greater quantity of sugar and fruit, the stronger the
vinegar.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Wine Vinegar.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>After making raisin wine, when the fruit has
been strained, lay it on a heap to heat: then to
every hundred weight put fifteen gallons of water.
Set the cask, and put yeast, &#38;c. as before.</p>

<p class='c010'>As vinegar is so necessary an article in a family,
and one on which so great a profit is made, a barrel
or two might always be kept preparing, according
to what suited. If the raisins of wine were ready,
that kind might be made: if a great plenty of gooseberries
made them cheap, that sort; or if neither,
then the sugar vinegar, so that the cask may not
be left empty, and grow musty.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Kitchen Pepper.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Mix in the finest powder, one ounce of ginger;
of cinnamon, black pepper, nutmeg, and Jamaica
pepper, half an ounce of each; ten cloves, and six
ounces of salt. Keep it in a bottle. It is an agreeable
addition to any brown sauces or soups.</p>

<p class='c010'>Spice in powder, kept in small bottles, close stopped,
goes much further than when used whole. It must
<span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>be dried before pounded; and should be done in quantities
that may be wanted in three or four months.
Nutmeg need not be done; but the others should be
kept in separate bottles, with a little label on each.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Browning, to colour and flavour made dishes.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Beat to powder four ounces of doubly refined sugar:
put it into a very nice iron fryingpan, with one
ounce of fine fresh butter: mix it well over a clear
fire, and when it begins to froth, hold it up higher.
When of a very fine dark brown, pour in a small
quantity of a pint of port wine; and the whole by very
slow degrees, stirring all the time. Put to the above
half an ounce of Jamaica, and the same of black pepper,
six cloves of shalots peeled, three blades of mace
bruised, three spoonfuls of mushroom, and the same
of walnut catsup, some salt, and the finely pared
rind of a lemon. Boil gently fifteen minutes; pour
it into a bason till cold; take off the scum, and
bottle for use.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>To make Sprats taste like Anchovies.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Salt them well, and let the salt drain from them.
In twenty four hours wipe them dry, but do not wash
them. Mix four ounces of common salt, an ounce
of bay salt, an ounce of saltpetre, a quarter of an
ounce of sal prunel, and half a teaspoonful of cochineal,
all in the finest powder. Sprinkle it among
three quarts of the fish, and pack them in two stone
jars. Keep in a cold place, fastened down with a
bladder.</p>

<p class='c010'>These are pleasant on bread and butter: but have
the best for sauce.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>
  <h3 class='c013'><i>To keep Anchovies when the liquor dries.</i></h3>
</div>

<p class='c014'>Pour on them beef brine.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>To keep Capers.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Add fresh vinegar, that has been scalded, and
become cold; and tie them close, to keep out the
air.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>To make Mustard.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Mix the best Durham flour of mustard by degrees,
with boiling water, to a proper thickness,
rubbing it perfectly smooth: add a little salt, and
keep it in a small jar, close covered; and put only
as much into the glass as will be used soon; which
should be wiped daily round the edges.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Another way for immediate use.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Mix the mustard with new milk by degrees, to
be quite smooth, and add a little raw cream. It is
much softer this way, is not bitter, and will keep
well.</p>

<p class='c010'>The patent mustard is by many preferred, and it
is perhaps as cheap, being always ready: and if the
pots are returned, three pence is allowed for each.</p>

<p class='c010'>A teaspoonful of sugar to half a pint of mustard,
is a great improvement, and softens it.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c006'>PICKLES.</h2>
</div>

<h3 class='c011'><i>India.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Lay a pound of white ginger in water one night:
then scrape, slice, and lay it in salt in a pan till the
other ingredients shall be ready.</p>

<p class='c010'>Peel, slice, and salt a pound of garlick three
days; then put it in the sun to dry. Salt and dry
long pepper in the same way.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>Prepare various sorts of vegetables thus:</p>

<p class='c010'>Quarter small white cabbages: salt three days:
squeeze and set them in the sun to dry.</p>

<p class='c010'>Cauliflowers cut in their branches: take off the
green from radishes: cut celery in three inch
lengths: ditto French beans whole, likewise the
shoots of alder, which will look like bamboo. Apples
and cucumbers, choose of the least seedy sort;
cut them in slices, or quarters, if not too large. All
must be salted, drained, and dried in the sun, except
the latter; over which you must pour boiling
vinegar, and, in twelve hours, drain them, but no
salt must be used.</p>

<p class='c010'>Put the spice, garlick, a quarter of a pound of
mustardseed, and as much vinegar as you think enough
for the quantity you are to pickle, into a large
stonejar, and one ounce of turmeric to be ready
against the vegetables shall be dried. When they
are ready, observe the following directions: put
some of them into a two quart stonejar, and pour
over them one quart of boiling vinegar: next day
take out those vegetables, and when drained, put
them into a large stock jar, and boiling the vinegar,
pour it over some more of the vegetables; let them
lie a night, and do as above. Thus proceed till
you have cleansed each set from the dust which
must inevitably fall on them by being so long in
doing: then, to every gallon of vinegar, put two
ounces of flour of mustard, mixing, by degrees,
with a little of it boiling hot. The whole of the
vinegar should have been previously scalded, but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>left to be cool before put to the spice. Stop the jar
tight.</p>

<p class='c010'>This pickle will not be ready for a year; but you
may make a small jar for eating in a fortnight, by
only giving them one scald in water, after salting
and drying as above, but without the preparative
vinegar; then pour the vinegar that has the spice
and garlick, boiling hot over. If at any time it be
found that the vegetables have not swelled properly,
boiling the pickle, and pouring it over them hot,
will plump them.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>English Bamboo, to Pickle.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Cut the large young shoots of alder, which put
out in the middle of May, (the middle stalks are
most tender) peel off the outward peel, or skin,
and lay them in salt and water, very strong, one
night. Dry them piece by piece in a cloth. Have
in readiness a pickle thus made and boiled. To a
quart of vinegar put an ounce of white pepper, an
ounce of sliced ginger, a little mace and pimento,
and pour boiling on the alder shoots, in a stonejar:
stop close, and set by the fire two hours, turning
the jar often, to keep scalding hot. If not green
when cold, strain, off the liquor, and pour boiling
hot again; keeping it hot as before. Or, if you
intend to make Indian pickle, the above shoots are a
great improvement to it: in which case you need
only pour boiling vinegar and mustardseed on them;
and keep them till your jar of pickles shall be
ready to receive them.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>
  <h3 class='c013'><i>Melon Mangoes.</i></h3>
</div>

<p class='c014'>There is a particular sort for this purpose which
the gardeners know. Cut a square small piece
out of one side, and through that take out the
seeds, and mix with them mustard seeds and shred
garlick; stuff the melon as full as the space will
allow, and replace the square piece. Bind it up
with a small new packthread. Boil a good quantity
of vinegar, to allow for wasting, with peppers, salt,
ginger, and pour boiling hot over the mangoes four
successive days; the last, put flour of mustard,
and scraped horseradish into the vinegar just as it
boils up. Stop close. Observe that there is plenty
of vinegar. All pickles are spoiled if not well
covered. Mangoes should be done soon after they
are gathered.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Pickled Onions.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>In the month of September, choose the small
white round onions, take off the brown skin; have
ready a very nice tin stewpan of boiling water;
throw in as many onions as will cover the top. As
soon as they look clear on the outside, take them
up as quick as possible with a slice, and lay them
on a clean cloth, cover them close with another,
and scald some more, and so on. Let them lie to
be cold, then put them in a jar, or glass widemouth
bottle, and pour over them the best white
wine vinegar, just hot, but not boiling. When
cold, cover them.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>
  <h3 class='c013'><i>Cucumbers and Onions sliced.</i></h3>
</div>

<p class='c014'>Cut them in slices, and sprinkle salt over them:
next day drain them for five or six hours, then
put them into a jar, and pour boiling vinegar over
them, keeping in a warm place. The slices should
be thick. Repeat the boiling vinegar, and stop
instantly; and so on till green.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Pickled sliced Cucumbers, another way.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Slice large unpared cucumbers, an inch thick;
slice onions, and put both into a broad pan: strew
a good deal of salt among them. In twenty four
hours drain them, and then lay them on a cloth to
dry. Put them in small stonejars, and pour in the
strongest plain vinegar, boiling hot: stop the jars
close. Next day boil it again, and pour over, and
thus thrice; the last time add whole white pepper,
and a little ginger. Keep close covered.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Young Cucumbers.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Choose nice young gherkins; spread them on
dishes; salt them, and let them lie a week: drain
them, and, putting them in a jar, pour boiling vinegar
over them. Set them near the fire, covered
with plenty of vineleaves. If they do not become
a tolerable good green, pour the vinegar into another
jar, set it over the hot hearth, and when it
boils, pour it over them again, covering with fresh
leaves; and thus do till they are of as good a colour
as you wish: but as it is now known, that the very
fine green pickles are made so by using brass or
bell metal vessels, which, when vinegar is put into
them, become highly poisonous, few people like to
eat them.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span><i>Note.</i> Acids dissolve the lead in the tinning of
saucepans. Pickles should never be kept in glazed
jars, but in stone or glass; and vinegar, or any
acids, should be boiled, by putting them in jars of
stone, over a hot hearth, or in a kettle of water.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>To Pickle Walnuts.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>When they will bear a pin to go into them, put
on them a brine of salt and water boiled, and strong
enough to bear an egg, being quite cold first. It
must be well skimmed while boiling. Let them
soak twelve days, then drain them, and pour over
them in the jar a pickle of the best white wine
vinegar, with a good quantity of pepper, pimento,
ginger, mace, cloves, mustardseed, and horseradish;
all boiled together, but cold. To every
hundred of walnuts, put six spoonfuls of mustardseed,
and two or three heads of garlick, or shalot;
but the latter is least strong.</p>

<p class='c010'>Thus done, they will be good for several years, if
kept close covered. The air will soften them.
They will not be fit to eat under six months.</p>

<p class='c010'>The pickle will serve as good catsup, when the
walnuts are used.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Nasturtions, for Capers.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Keep them a few days after they are gathered;
then pour boiling vinegar over them, and when
cold, cover.</p>

<p class='c010'>They will not be fit to eat for some months; but
are then finely flavoured, and by many preferred
to capers.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>
  <h3 class='c013'><i>An excellent way to Pickle Mushrooms, to preserve the flavour.</i></h3>
</div>

<p class='c014'>Buttons must be rubbed with a bit of flannel and
salt; and from the larger, take out the <i>red</i> inside,
for when they are <i>black</i> they will not do, being too
old. Throw a little salt over, and put them into a
stewpan, with some mace, and pepper. As the
liquor comes out, shake them well, and keep them
over a gentle fire till all of it be dried into them
again; then put as much vinegar into the pan as
will cover them; give it one warm, and turn all
into a glass or stonejar. They will keep two years,
and are delicious.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Red Cabbage.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Slice it into a colander, and sprinkle each layer
with salt; let it drain two days, then put it into a
jar, and pour boiling vinegar enough to cover, and
put a few slices of red beet root. Observe to choose
the purple red cabbage. Those who like the flavour
of spice, will boil it with the vinegar. Cauliflower,
cut in branches, and thrown in after being
salted, will look of a beautiful red.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c006'><i>To Stew Green Peas.</i></h2>
</div>
<p class='c015'>Put a quart of pease, a lettuce, an onion, both
sliced, a bit of butter, pepper, salt, and no more
water than hangs round the lettuce from washing.
Stew them two hours very gently. When to be
served, beat up an egg, and stir into them, or a bit
of flour and butter.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>Some think a teaspoonful of white powdered
sugar is an improvement. Gravy may be added;
but there will be less of the flavour of the peas.
Chop a bit of mint, and stew in them.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>To stew Cucumbers.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Slice them thick, or halve, and divide them in
two lengths: strew some salt and pepper, and slice
onions; add a little broth, or a bit of butter. Simmer
very slowly; and, before serving, if no butter
was in before, put some, and a little flour; or if it
was in, only a little flour, unless it wants richness.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Another way.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Slice the onions, and cut the cucumbers large;
flour and fry them in some butter: then pour on
some good broth or gravy, and stew till enough.
Skim off the fat.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Stewed Onions.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Peel six large onions: fry them gently of a fine
brown, but do not blacken; then put them in a
small stewpan, with a little weak gravy, pepper,
and salt: cover and stew two hours gently. They
should be lightly floured at first.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Roast Onions.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Should be done with all the skins on. They eat
well alone, with salt only, and cold butter; or with
roast potatoes, or with beetroots.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Stewed Celery.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Wash, and strip off the outer leaves of six heads;
halve, or leave them whole according to their size;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>cut them in four inch lengths. Put them in a
stewpan with a cup of broth, or weak white gravy.
Stew till tender; then add two spoonfuls of cream,
and a little flour and butter, seasoned with pepper,
salt, and nutmeg, and simmer all together.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Cauliflower in white Sauce.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Half boil, then cut into handsome pieces, and
lay into a stewpan, with a little broth, a bit of mace,
a little salt, and a dust of white pepper. Simmer
half an hour; then put a little cream, butter, and
flour; shake and simmer a few minutes, and serve.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Spinach</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Should be very carefully picked and washed;
then boil, and squeeze it dry. Put it in a pan with
a bit of butter, salt, and pepper; stew it, and serve.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>French way.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Clean as before; then put it into a stewpan without
water, a spoonful of gravy, and a lump of butter,
salt, and pepper, and simmer till ready. If
too moist, squeeze the gravy from it.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Stewed Red Cabbage.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Slice a small, or half a large red cabbage: wash
it, and put into a saucepan, with pepper and salt,
no water but what hangs about the former, and a
piece of butter. Stew till quite tender; then when
going to serve, put to it half a cup of vinegar, and
stir it over the fire.</p>

<p class='c010'>Serve for cold meat, or with sausages on it.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>
  <h3 class='c013'><i>Stewed Mushrooms.</i></h3>
</div>

<p class='c014'>Choose large buttons, or small flaps, before the
fringe be turned black: pick each one separately,
and observe there is not a bad one; rub the former,
with a flannel and salt, skin the latter, and take out
the fringe. Throw them into a stewpan, with a
little salt, a piece of butter, and a few peppers; set
them on a slack part of the fire, and shake them
sometime. When tender, add two large spoonfuls
of cream, and a dust of flour.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Stewed Sorrel for Fricandeau, and roast Meat.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Wash the sorrel, and put it in a silver vessel, or
stonejar, and no more water than hangs to the
leaves. Simmer in the slowest way you can; and
when done enough, put a bit of butter, and beat it
well.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Stewed Carrots.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Half boil, then nicely scrape, and slice them into
a stewpan. Put to them half a teacup of any weak
broth, some pepper, and salt, and half a cup of
cream; simmer to be very tender, but not broke.
Before serving, rub the least flour with a bit of
butter, and warm up with it. If approved, chopped
parsley may be added ten minutes before served.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Stewed old Peas.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Steep them in water all night, if not fine boilers,
otherwise only half an hour; put them with water
enough just to cover them, and a good bit of butter,
or a piece of beef or pork. Stew in the most gentle
way till the peas are soft, and the meat is tender.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>If not salt meat, add salt, and a little pepper, and
serve round the meat.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c006'><i>French Sallad.</i></h2>
</div>
<p class='c015'>Chop three anchovies, a shalot, and some parsley
small; put them in a bowl with two tablespoonfuls
of vinegar, one of oil, a little mustard, and salt.
When well mixed, add by degrees some cold roast
or boiled meat in the very thinnest slices; put in a
few at a time, they being small, not exceeding two
or three inches long; shake them in the seasoning,
and then put more; cover the bowl close; and
let the sallad be prepared three hours before it be
eaten.</p>

<p class='c010'>Garnish with parsley, and a few slices of the fat.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Lobster Sallad.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Make a sallad, and put some of the red part of
the lobster to it, cut; which forms a pretty contrast
to the white and green of the vegetables.</p>

<p class='c010'>Do not put much oil, as shellfish take off the
acidity of vinegar.</p>

<p class='c010'>Serve in a dish, not a bowl.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>To boil Potatoes.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Set them on a fire, unpared, in cold water; let
them half boil, then throw some salt in, and a pint
of cold water, and let them boil again till near
done. Pour off the water, and put a clean cloth
over them, and then the saucepan cover, and set
them by the fire to steam till ready. Many use
steamers.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>
  <h3 class='c013'><i>To broil Potatoes.</i></h3>
</div>

<p class='c014'>Parboil, then slice and broil them; or parboil,
and set them whole on the gridiron over a very
slow fire; and when thoroughly done, send up with
their skins on. The latter is done in many Irish
families.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>To roast Potatoes.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Half boil, take off the thin peel, and roast them
of a beautiful brown.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>To fry Potatoes.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Slice raw potatoes after the skin is removed, and
fry either in butter, or thin batter.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>To mash Potatoes.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Boil, peel, and break to paste the potatoes; then,
to two pounds, add a quarter of a pint of milk, and
a little salt, with two or three ounces of butter, and
stir all well over the fire. Serve thus, or brown
the top, when placed on the dish in a form, with a
salamander; or in scollops.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>To mash Parsnips.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Boil tender; scrape them; then mash into a
stewpan, with a little cream, a good piece of butter,
pepper, and salt.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>To keep Green Peas.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Shell, and put them into a kettle of water when
it boils: give them two or three warms only, and
pour them into a colander. When the water drains
off, turn them on a dresser covered with cloth;
pour them on another cloth to dry perfectly: then
bottle them in widemouth bottles, leaving only
<span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>room to pour clarified mutton suet upon them an
inch thick, and for the cork; rosin it down, and
keep in a cellar, or in the earth, as ordered for
gooseberries. Boil them, with a bit of butter, a
spoonful of sugar, and a bit of mint, till tender,
when to be used.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Another way, as practised in the Emperor of Russia’s Kitchen.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Shell, scald, and dry as above. Put them on tins
or earthen dishes in a cool oven to harden, once or
twice. Keep them in paper bags hung up in the
kitchen. When to be used, let them lie an hour
in water; then set them on with cold water, and a
bit of butter, and boil till ready. Put a sprig of
dried mint to boil with them.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>To preserve French Beans, to eat in the Winter.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Pick them young, and throw into a little wooden
keg a layer three inches deep; then sprinkle with
salt: put another layer of beans, and do the same
as high as you think proper, alternately with salt;
but do not be too liberal of the latter: lay a plate,
or cover of wood that will go into the keg, and put
on it a heavy stone. A pickle will rise from the
beans and salt. If too salt, the soaking and boiling
will not be sufficient to make them pleasant to the
taste. When to be eaten, cut, soak, and boil as
when fresh.</p>

<p class='c010'>Potatoes should be kept in the earth that adheres
to them when dug; and preserved from frost.</p>

<p class='c010'>Carrots, parsnips, and turnips the same, and put
in layers of dry sand.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>Small close cabbages laid on a stone floor before
the frost sets in, will blanch and be very fine, after
many weeks’ keeping.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>To boil Vegetables Green.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Be sure the water boils when you put them in;
when in, make them boil very fast. Do not cover,
but watch them; and if the water has not slackened,
you may be assured they are done when they
are beginning to sink; take them out immediately,
or the colour will change.</p>

  <h2 class='c006'><i>Small Dishes for Supper, &#38;c.</i></h2>
</div>
<p class='c015'>Boil eggs hard, cut them in half, take out the
yelks, set the whites on a dish, and fill with the following
several ingredients; or put a saucer upside
down on a plate, and place them in quarters round:
in either case as a salmagundi. Chopped veal,
yelk of egg, beetroot, anchovy, apple, onion, ham,
and parsley. A very small bit of the white of the
egg must be cut off, to make it stand on the dish
as a cup.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Orange Butter.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Boil six eggs hard: beat the yelks in a mortar
with fine sugar, orange flower water, four ounces
of butter, and two ounces of almonds beaten to a
paste. When all is mixed, rub it through a colander
on a dish.</p>

<p class='c010'>Roll butter in different forms; either like a pine,
having made it in the shape of a cone, and marking
it with a teaspoon; or rolling in a crimping form,
or working it through a colander. Serve with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>scraped beef or anchovies, garnished with a wreath

  <h2 class='c006'><i>Forcemeat for Patties, Balls or Stuffing.</i></h2>
</div>
<p class='c015'>Crumbs of bread, chopped parsley, fat bacon, (if
it has been dressed it is the better,) suet, a bit of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>fresh butter, a little anchovy liquor, an egg, a bit of
onion, a very little knotted marjorum, a little pepper,
salt, and nutmeg.</p>

<p class='c010'>This is a much admired mixture; but, according
to the purpose it is for, any addition may be made
to the flavour. Cold ham or gammon, different
herbs, anchovies, oysters, Cayenne.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Note.</i> To the above should have been added cold
veal or chicken, which is a great improvement.
Some like lemon, and lemon thyme is a good substitute.
Tarragon gives a French flavour, but a
very small proportion is sufficient.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c006'><i>Fried Patties.</i></h2>
</div>
<p class='c015'>Mince a bit of cold veal, and six oysters; mix
with a few crumbs of bread, salt, pepper, nutmeg,
and a very small bit of lemonpeel; add the liquor
of the oysters: warm all in a tosser, but do not boil.
Let it go cold. Have ready a good puff paste, roll
thin, and cut it in round or square bits. Put some
of the above between two of them; twist the edges
to keep in the gravy, and fry them of a fine brown.</p>

<p class='c010'>This is a very good thing; and baked, is a fashionable
dish.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Oyster Patties.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Put a fine puff paste into small pattypans, and
a bit of bread in each; and against they are baked,
have ready the following to fill with, taking out the
bread. Take off the beards of the oysters; cut the
other parts in small bits; put them in a small tosser,
with a grate of nutmeg, the least white pepper,
and salt, a morsel of lemonpeel, cut so small that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>you can scarcely see it, a little cream, and a little
of the oyster liquor. Simmer for a few minutes
before you fill.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Lobster Patties.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Make with the same seasoning, a little cream,
and the smallest bit of butter.</p>

<p class='c010'>Beef and veal patties, as likewise turkey and
chicken, are under the several articles in the foregoing
pages.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Sweet Patties.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Chop the meat of a boiled calf’s foot, of which
you use the liquor for jelly, two apples, one ounce
of orange and lemonpeel candied, and some fresh
peel and juice: mix with them half a nutmeg
grated, the yelk of an egg, a spoonful of brandy,
and four ounces of currants washed and dried.</p>

<p class='c010'>Bake in small pattypans.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Patties resembling Mincepies.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Chop the kidney and fat of cold veal, apple, orange
and lemonpeel candied, and fresh currants, a
little wine, two or three cloves, a little brandy, and
a bit of sugar. Bake in puff paste as before.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Mincepie</i>.</h3>

<p class='c014'>Of scraped beef free from skin and strings,
weigh two pounds; four pounds of suet picked and
chopped; then add six pounds of currants, nicely
cleaned and perfectly dry, three pounds of chopped
apples, the peel and juice of two lemons, a pint of
sweet wine, a nutmeg, a quarter of an ounce of
cloves, ditto mace, ditto pimento, in finest powder;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>press the whole into a deep pan when well mixed,
and keep it covered in a dry cool place.</p>

<p class='c010'>Half the quantity is enough, unless for a very
large family.</p>

<p class='c010'>Have citron, orange, and lemonpeel ready, and
put some of each in the pies when made.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Mincepies, without Meat.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Of the best apples six pounds, pared, cored, and
minced; of fresh suet, and raisins stoned, each
three pounds, likewise minced: to these add of
mace and cinnamon a quarter of an ounce each, and
eight cloves, in finest powder, three pounds of the
finest powder sugar, three quarters of an ounce of
salt, the rinds of four and juice of two lemons, half
a pint of port wine, and the same of brandy. Mix
well, and put into a deep pan.</p>

<p class='c010'>Have ready washed and dried four pounds of
currants, and add as you make the pies, with candied
fruit.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Lemon Mincepies.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Squeeze a large lemon: boil the outside till tender
enough to beat to a mash: add to it three large
apples chopped, four ounces of suet, half a pound
of currants, and four ounces of sugar. Put the
juice of the lemon and candied fruit, as for other
pies. Make a short crust, and fill the patty pans
as usual.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Egg Mincepies.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Boil six eggs hard, and shred them small: shred
double the quantity of suet; then put currants
<span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>washed and picked, one pound or more, if the eggs
were large; the peel of one lemon shred very fine,
half the juice, six spoonfuls of sweet wine, mace,
nutmeg, sugar, a very little salt, orange, lemon,
and citron candied. Make a light paste for them.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Savory Rice.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Wash and pick some rice: stew it very gently
in a small quantity of veal, or rich mutton broth,
with an onion, a blade of mace, pepper, and salt.
When swelled, but not boiled to mash, dry it on
the shallow end of a sieve before the fire, and either
serve it dry, or put it in the middle of a dish, and
pour the gravy round, having heated it.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Buttered Rice.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Prepare some rice as above: drain, and put it
with some new milk, enough just to swell it, over
the fire. When tender, pour off the milk, and add
a bit of butter, a little sugar, and pounded cinnamon.
Shake it, that it do not burn, and serve.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Rice boiled to eat with Curry or roast Meats.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Prepare as above; then put it into a large quantity
of water, boil it quick, throw in a little salt, and
observe the very moment when it is swelled large,
but not too much softened; then drain off the
water, and pour the rice on the shallow end of a
sieve: set it before a fire, and let it stay until it
separates and dries. Serve it without sauce of any
kind.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Omlet.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Make a batter of eggs and milk, and a very little
flour; put to it chopped parsley, onions, or chives
<span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>(the latter is best); or a very small quantity of
shalot, a little pepper, salt, and a scrape or two of
nutmeg. Make some very nice dripping: boil in a
small fryingpan, and pour the above batter into it.
When one side is of a fine yellow brown, turn and
do the other. Some scraped lean ham, put in at
first, is a very pleasant addition. Three eggs will
make a pretty sized omlet; but many cooks will
use eight or ten.</p>

<p class='c010'>If the taste be approved, a <i>little</i> tarragon gives
a fine flavour. A good deal of parsley should be
used.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Ramakins.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Scrape a quarter of a pound of Cheshire, and ditto
of Gloucester cheese, ditto of good fresh butter;
then beat all in a mortar with the yelks of four
eggs, and the inside of a small French roll boiled
in cream till soft. Mix the paste then with the
whites of the eggs previously beaten, and put into
small paper pans made rather long than square,
and bake in a Dutch oven till of a fine brown.
They should be eaten quite hot.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Bacon Fraise.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Cut streaked bacon in thin slices an inch long;
make a batter of milk, well beaten eggs, and flour;
put a little lard or dripping into the pan, and when
hot pour the batter in, and cover it with a dish.
When fit to turn, put in the bacon, and turn it very
carefully, that the bacon does not touch the pan.</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>
  <h3 class='c013'><i>Rich Puff Paste.</i></h3>
</div>

<p class='c014'>Weigh an equal quantity of butter with as much
fine flour as you judge necessary; mix a little of
the former with the latter, and wet it with as little
water as will make into a stiff paste. Roll it out,
and put all the butter over it in slices; turn in
the ends, and roll it thin; do this twice, and touch
it no more than can be avoided. The butter may
be added at twice; and to those who are not accustomed
to make paste, it may be better to do so.</p>

<p class='c010'>A quicker oven than for short crust.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>A less rich Paste.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Weigh a pound of flour, and a quarter of a pound
of butter; rub them together, and mix into a paste
with a little water, and an egg well beaten; of the
former as little as will suffice, or the paste will be
tough. Roll, and fold it three or four times.</p>

<p class='c010'>Rub extremely fine, in one pound of dried flour,
six ounces of butter, and a spoonful of white sugar.
Work up the whole into a stiff paste, with as little
<i>hot</i> water as possible.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>German Puffs another way.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Boil two ounces of fresh butter in half a pint of
cream; stir until cold; then beat two eggs, strain
them into the cream, and mix that by degrees into
two table spoonfuls of flour: butter teacups, and
into each put three spoonfuls of the batter; bake
them half an hour, and serve the moment they are
to be eaten, turned out of the cups, with sauce
of melted butter, sugar, and the juice of a lemon.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>
  <h3 class='c013'><i>Excellent short Crust.</i></h3>
</div>

<p class='c014'>Make two ounces of white sugar, pounded and
sifted, quite dry; then mix it with a pound of
flour well dried; rub into it three ounces of butter
so fine as not to be seen: into some cream put the
yelks of two eggs beaten, and mix the above into a
smooth paste; roll it thin, and bake in a moderate
oven.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Another.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Mix with a pound of fine flour, dried, an ounce
of sugar pounded and sifted; then crumble three
ounces of butter in it, till it looks all like flour, and
with a gill of boiling cream, work it up to a fine
paste.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Light Paste for Tarts and Cheesecakes.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Beat the white of an egg to a strong froth; then
mix it with as much water as will make three quarters
of a pound of fine flour into a very stiff paste:
roll it very thin, then lay the third part of half a
pound of butter upon it in little bits: dredge it with
some flour, left out at first, and roll it up tight.
Roll it out again, and put the same proportion of
butter; and so proceed till all be worked up.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>A very fine Crust for Orange Cheesecakes or Sweetmeats, when to be particularly nice.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Dry a pound of the finest flour, and mix with it
three ounces of refined sugar; then work half a
pound of butter with your hand till it comes to a
froth. Put the flour into it by degrees; and work
into it, well beaten, and strained, the yelks of three
and whites of two eggs. If too limber, put some
<span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>flour and sugar to make fit to roll. Line your pattypans
and fill. A little above fifteen minutes will
bake them. Against they come out, have ready
some refined sugar, beat up with the white of an
egg, as thick as you can: ice them all over: set
them in the oven to harden, and serve cold. Use
fresh butter.</p>

<p class='c010'>Salt butter will make a very fine flaky crust;
but if for mincepies, or any sweet thing, should be
washed.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Raised Crust for Custards or Fruit.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Put four ounces of butter into a saucepan with
water; and when it boils, pour it into as much
flour as you choose, knead and beat it till smooth:
cover it as on the other side. Raise it; and if for
custard, put a paper within to keep out the sides
till half done, then fill with a cold mixture of milk,
egg, sugar, and a little peachwater, lemonpeel, or
nutmeg. By cold is meant that the egg is not to
be warmed, but the milk should be warmed by itself;
not to spoil the crust.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Raised Crust for Meatpies or Fowls, &#38;c.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Boil water with a little fine lard, and an equal
quantity of fresh dripping, or of butter, but not
much of either. While hot, mix this with as much
flour as you will want, making the paste as stiff as
you can to be smooth, which you will make it by
good kneading, and beating with the rolling pin.
When quite smooth, put it in a lump into a cloth,
or under a pan to soak, till near cold.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>Those who have not a good hand at raising crust,
may do thus: roll the paste of a proper thickness,
and cut out the top and bottom of the pie, then a
long piece for the sides. Cement the bottom to the
sides with egg, bringing the former rather further
out, and pinching both together; put egg between
the edges of the paste to make it adhere at the
sides. Fill your pie, and put on the cover, and
pinch it and the side crust together. The same
mode of uniting the paste is to be observed, if the
sides are pressed into a tin form, in which the paste
must be baked, after it shall be filled and covered;
but in the latter case the tin should be buttered,
and carefully taken off when done enough; and as
the form usually makes the sides of a lighter colour
than is proper, the paste should be put into the
oven again for a quarter of an hour. With a feather
put egg over at first.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Crust for Venison Pastry.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>To a quarter of a peck of fine flour use two
pounds and a half of butter, and four eggs: mix
into paste with warm water, and work it smooth
and to a good consistence. Put a paste round the
inside, but not to the bottom of the dish, and let the
cover be pretty thick, to bear the long continuance
in the oven.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Rice Pastry.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Boil a quarter of a pound of ground rice in the
smallest quantity of water: strain from it all the
moisture as well as you can. Beat it in a mortar,
with half an ounce of butter, and one egg well beaten,
and it will make an excellent paste for tarts, &#38;c.</p>

  <h3 class='c013'><i>Potatoe Pastry.</i></h3>
</div>

<p class='c014'>Pound boiled potatoes very fine; and add, while
warm, a sufficiency of butter to make the mash
hold together. Or you may mix with it an egg;
then before it gets cold, flour the board pretty well
to prevent it from sticking, and roll it to the thickness
wanted.</p>

<p class='c010'>If it is become quite cold before it be put on the
dish, it will be apt to crack.</p>

  <h2 class='c006'>PUDDINGS.</h2>
</div>

<h3 class='c011'><i>Almond Puddings.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Beat half a pound of sweet and a few bitter almonds,
with a spoonful of water; then mix four
ounces of butter, four eggs, two spoonfuls of cream
warm with the butter, one of brandy, a little nutmeg
and sugar to taste. Butter some cups, half
fill, and bake the puddings.</p>

<p class='c010'>Serve with butter, wine, and sugar.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Sago Pudding.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Boil a pint and a half of new milk with four
spoonfuls of sago, nicely washed and picked, lemonpeel,
cinnamon, and nutmeg. Sweeten to taste;
then mix four eggs, put a paste round the dish,
and bake slowly.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Bread and Butter Pudding.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Slice bread, spread with butter, and lay it in a
dish with currants between each layer, and sliced
citron, orange or lemon, if to be very nice. Pour
over an unboiled custard of milk, two or three
eggs, a few pimentos, and a very little ratafia, two
hours at least before it is to be baked; and lade it
over and over to soak the bread.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>A paste round the edge makes all puddings look
better, but is not necessary.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Orange Pudding.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Grate the rind of a Seville orange; put to it six
ounces of fresh butter, six or eight ounces of lump
sugar pounded: beat them all in a marble mortar,
and add as you do it the whole of eight eggs well
beaten and strained: scrape a raw apple, and mix
with the rest; put a paste at the bottom and sides
of the dish, and, over the orange mixture, put crossbars
of paste. Half an hour will bake it.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Another Orange Pudding.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Mix of the orange paste hereafter directed two
full spoons, with six eggs, four of sugar, four ounces
of butter warm, and put into a shallow dish, with a
paste lining. Bake twenty minutes.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Another.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Rather more than two table spoonfuls of the
orange paste, mixed with six eggs, four ounces of
sugar, and four ounces of butter, melted, will make
a good sized pudding, with a paste at the bottom
of the dish. Bake twenty minutes.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>An excellent Lemon Pudding.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Beat the yelks of four eggs; add four ounces of
white sugar, the rind of a lemon being rubbed with
some lumps of it to take the essence: then peel,
and beat it in a mortar with the juice of a large
lemon, and mix all with four or five ounces of butter
warmed. Put a crust into a shallow dish; nick
the edges, and put the above into it. When served,
turn the pudding out of the dish.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>
  <h3 class='c013'><i>A very fine Amber Pudding.</i></h3>
</div>

<p class='c014'>Put a pound of butter into a saucepan, with three
quarters of a pound of loaf sugar, finely powdered;
melt the butter and mix well with it: then add the
yelks of fifteen eggs well beaten, and as much fresh
candied orange, as will add colour and flavour to it,
being first beaten to a fine paste. Line the dish
with paste for turning out; and when filled with
the above, lay a crust over, as you would a pie,
and bake it in a slow oven.</p>

<p class='c010'>It is as good cold as hot.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Baked Apple Pudding.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Pare and quarter four large apples; boil them
tender, with the rind of a lemon, in so little water
that when done, none may remain: beat them quite
fine in a mortar: add the crumbs of a small roll,
four ounces of butter melted, the yelks of five and
whites of three eggs, juice of half a lemon, and sugar
to taste. Beat all together, and lay it in a dish
with paste to turn out.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Oatmeal Pudding.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Pour a quart of boiling milk over a pint of the
best <i>fine</i> oatmeal; let it soak all night. Next day
beat two eggs, and mix a little salt: butter a bason
that will just hold it: cover it tight with a floured
cloth, and boil it an hour and a half. Eat it with
cold butter and salt.</p>

<p class='c010'>When cold, slice and toast it, and eat it as oatcake
buttered.</p>

<span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>spoonfuls of yeast: add one pound of currants, a
quarter of a pound of sugar beaten and sifted.</p>

<p class='c010'>This is a very good pudding hot; and equally so
as a cake when cold. If for the latter, carraways
may be used instead of currants. An hour will
bake it in a quick oven.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>A Dutch Rice Pudding.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Soak four ounces of rice in warm water half an
hour: drain the latter from it, and throw it into a
stewpan, with half a pint of milk, half a stick of
cinnamon, and simmer till tender. When cold,
add four whole eggs well beaten, two ounces of butter
melted in a teacupful of cream; and put three
ounces of sugar, a quarter of a nutmeg, and a good
piece of lemonpeel.</p>

<p class='c010'>Put a light puff paste into a mould or dish, or
grated tops and bottoms, and bake in a quick oven.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Light, or German Puddings.</i></h3>

let it stand till nearly cold, then mix two ounces of
fine flour, and two ounces of sugar, four yelks and
two whites of eggs, and a little rose or orange
flower water. Bake in little cups, buttered, half an
hour. They should be served the moment they
are done, and only when going to be eaten, or they
will not be light.</p>

<p class='c010'>Turn out of the cups, and serve with white wine
and sugar.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Little Bread Puddings.</i></h3>

of butter warmed, sugar, orange flower water, a
spoonful of brandy, a little nutmeg, and a teacupful
of cream. Beat all well, and bake in teacups buttered.
If currants are chosen, a quarter of a pound
is sufficient; if not, they are good without; or you
may put orange or lemon candy. Serve with pudding
sauce.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Puddings in haste.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Shred suet, and put with grated bread, a few currants,

egg, with a little flour.</p>

<p class='c010'>Have ready a skellet of boiling water, and throw
them in. Twenty minutes will boil them; but they

handful of sugar, half a nutmeg, three eggs beaten,
yelk and white separately. Mix, and make into
the size and shape of a goose egg. Put half a
pound of butter into a fryingpan; and when melted,
and quite hot, stew them gently in it over a stove.
Turn them two or three times till of a fine light
brown. Mix a glass of brandy with the batter.</p>

seasoned meat of any kind into it, and a little shred

<p class='c014'>Wash two large spoonfuls of rice, and simmer it
with half a pint of milk till thick. Then put with

<p class='c014'>Boil and blanch old beans, beat them in a mortar
with very little pepper and salt, some cream, and
the yelk of an egg. A little spinach juice will give

a bason that will just hold it, for an hour and pour
parsley and butter over.</p>

ditto, with a little wine, yelks of six eggs, peel of two
lemons grated, six ounces of butter, near a quart of

eggs, a little good milk, some lemonpeel, and a
little salt. Boil it in a melon shape six hours.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Brandy Pudding.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Line a mould with jar raisins stoned, or dried
cherries, then with thin slices of French roll; next
to which put ratafias, or macaroons, then the fruit,
roll, and cakes in succession, until the mould be
full; sprinkling in at times two glasses of brandy.
Beat four eggs, yelks and whites: put to them a pint
of milk or cream, lightly sweetened, with half a nutmeg,
and the rind of half a lemon finely grated. Let
the liquid sink into the solid part; then flour a cloth,
tie it tight over, and boil one hour; keep the mould
the right side up. Serve with pudding sauce.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Buttermilk Pudding.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Warm three quarts of new milk, and turn it with
a quart of buttermilk: when ready, drain the curd
<span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>through a sieve: when dry, pound it in a marble
mortar, with near half a pound of sugar, a lemon
boiled tender, the crumbs of a roll grated, a nutmeg

<p class='c014'>Turn two quarts of milk to curd; press the whey
from it; rub it through a sieve, and mix four ounces
of butter, the crumbs of a penny loaf, two spoonfuls

and two spoonfuls of white wine. Butter little cups,
or small pattypans, and fill them three parts.

<p class='c010'>Serve with sweet sauce in a boat.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Boiled Curd Pudding.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Rub the curd of two gallons of milk, when drained,

cream, two spoonfuls of orange flower water, half a
nutmeg, of flour and crumbs of bread each three
spoonfuls, currants and raisins half a pound of each.
Boil an hour in a thick well floured cloth.</p>

  <h3 class='c013'><i>Small Almond Puddings.</i></h3>
</div>

<p class='c014'>Pound eight ounces of almonds, and a few bitter,

<h3 class='c013'><i>Excellent light Puffs.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Mix two spoonfuls of flour, a little grated lemonpeel,

batter at a time: turn as they brown. They will be
large. Serve immediately. Sweet sauce.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Pippin Pudding.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Coddle six pippins in vineleaves covered with
water, but very gently, that the inside be done without
breaking the skins. When soft, take off the
skins, and with a teaspoon take the pulp from the
core. Press it through a colander; add to it two
spoonfuls of orange flower water, three eggs beaten,
a pint of scalded cream, sugar and nutmeg to taste.
Lay a thin puff paste at the bottom and sides of the
dish: shred some very thin lemonpeel as fine as
possible, and put into the dish; as likewise some
orange and citron in small slices.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>
  <h3 class='c013'><i>Yorkshire Pudding.</i></h3>
</div>

<p class='c014'>Mix five spoonfuls of flour, with a quart of milk,
and three eggs well beaten. Butter the pan. When
brown by baking under the meat, turn the other
side upwards, and brown that. It should be made
in a square pan, and cut into pieces to come to table.
Set it over a chafing dish at first, and stir it some
minutes.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>A quick made Pudding.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Flour and suet half a pound each, four eggs, a
quarter of a pint of new milk, a little mace and nutmeg,
a quarter of a pound of raisins, ditto of currants:
mix well, and boil three quarters of an hour
with the cover of the pot on, or it will require
longer.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Yeast or Suffolk Dumplings.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Make a very light dough with yeast, as for bread,
but with milk instead of water, and put salt. Let
it rise an hour before the fire.</p>

<p class='c010'>Twenty minutes before you are to serve, have
ready a large stewpan of boiling water. Make the
dough into balls, the size of a middling apple, throw
them in, and boil twenty minutes. If you doubt
when done enough, stick a clean fork into one, and
if it come out clear, it is done.</p>

<p class='c010'>The way to eat them is to tear them apart on the
top with two forks, for they become heavy by their
own steam. Eat immediately with meat, sugar,
butter or salt.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>
  <h3 class='c013'><i>Russian Seed, or ground Rice Pudding.</i></h3>
</div>

<p class='c014'>Boil a large spoonful heaped of either in a pint
of new milk, with lemonpeel and cinnamon. When
cold add sugar, nutmeg, and two eggs, well beaten.
Bake with a crust round the dish.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Observations on making Puddings.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>The outside of a boiled pudding often tastes disagreeably,
which arises from the cloth not being
nicely washed, and kept in a dry place. It should
be dipped in boiling water, squeezed dry, and floured,
when to be used.</p>

<p class='c010'>If bread, it should be tied loose; if batter, tight
over.</p>

<p class='c010'>The water should boil quick when the pudding is
put in; and it should be moved about for a minute,
lest the ingredients should not mix.</p>

<p class='c010'>Batter pudding should be strained through a
coarse sieve, when all is mixed. In others the
eggs separately.</p>

<p class='c010'>The pans and basons must be always buttered.</p>

<p class='c010'>A pan of cold water should be ready, and the
pudding dipt in as soon as it comes out of the pot,
and then it will not adhere to the cloth.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c006'>SWEET DISHES.</h2>
</div>

<h3 class='c011'><i>Lemon Custards.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Beat the yelks of eight eggs till they are as white
as milk; then put to them a pint of boiling water,
the rinds of two lemons grated, and the juice sweetened
<span class='pageno' id='Page_160'>160</span>to your taste. Stir it on the fire till thick
enough, then add a large glass of rich wine, and
half a glass of brandy; give the whole one scald,
and put it in cups, to be eaten cold.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Lent Potatoes.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Beat three or four ounces of almonds, and three
or four bitter, when blanched, putting a little orange
flower water to prevent oiling: add eight ounces of
butter, four eggs well beaten and strained, half a
glass of raisin wine, and sugar to your taste. Beat
all well till quite smooth, and grate in three Savoy
biscuit. Make balls of the above, with a little flour,
the size of a chestnut; throw them into a stewpan
of boiling lard, and boil them of a beautiful yellow
brown. Drain them on a sieve.</p>

<p class='c010'>Serve sweet sauce in a boat, to eat with them.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Rice Flummery.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Boil with a pint of new milk, a bit of lemonpeel,
and cinnamon: mix with a little cold milk, as much
rice flour as will make the whole of a good consistence:
sweeten, and add a spoonful of peachwater,
or a bitter almond beaten. Boil it, observing it
does not burn. Pour it into a shape or pint bason,
taking out the spice. When cold, turn the flummery
into a dish, and serve with cream, milk, or
custard round; or put a teaspoonful of cream into
half a pint of new milk, a glass of raisin wine, a
little sugar, and a squeeze of lemon.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Curds and Cream.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Turn to curd three or four pints of milk with
runnet; break it, and let the whey run out, then
<span class='pageno' id='Page_161'>161</span>put it into a bason; and when to be served, but it
on a dish with some cream, or fine milk, either
plain or sweetened.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Another way.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>To four quarts of new milk warmed, put from a
pint to a quart of buttermilk strained, according to
its sourness; keep the pan covered until the curd
be of a firmness to cut three or four times across
with a saucer, as the whey leaves it: put it into a
shape, and fill up until it is solid enough to take
the form. Serve with cream plain, or mixed with
sugar, wine, and lemon.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>London Syllabub.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Put a pint of port or white wine into a bowl, nutmeg
grated, and a good deal of sugar, then milk
into it near two quarts of milk, frothed up. If the
wine be not rather sharp, it will require more for
this quantity of milk.</p>

<p class='c010'>In Devonshire, clouted cream is put on the top,
and pounded cinnamon and sugar.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Staffordshire Syllabub.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Put a pint of cyder, and a glass of brandy, sugar,
and nutmeg into a bowl, and milk into it; or
pour warm milk from a large teapot some height
into it.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Devonshire Junket.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Put warm milk into a bowl; turn it with runnet;
then put some scalded cream, sugar and cinnamon
on the top, without breaking the curd.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>
  <h3 class='c013'><i>A very fine Somersetshire Syllabub.</i></h3>
</div>

<p class='c014'>In a large China bowl put a pint of port, and a
pint of sherry, or other white wine; sugar to taste.
Milk the bowl full. In twenty minutes cover it
pretty high with clouted cream; grate over it nutmeg:
put pounded cinnamon and nonpareil comfits.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Sack Cream.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Boil a pint of raw cream, the yelk of an egg well
beaten, two or three spoonfuls of white wine, sugar,
and lemonpeel; stir it over a gentle fire till it be
as thick as rich cream; put it in a dish, and serve
it cold, garnished with rusks or sippets of toasted
bread.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>A Froth to set on Cream, Custard, or Trifle, which looks and eats well.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Sweeten half a pound of the pulp of damsons, or
any other sort of scalded fruit: put to it the whites
of four eggs beaten, and beat the pulp with them,
until it will stand as high as you choose; and being
put on the cream, &#38;c. with a spoon, it will take any
form. It should be rough to imitate a rock.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Floating Island.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Mix three half pints of thin cream with a quarter
of a pint of raisin wine, a little lemonjuice, orange
flower water, and sugar; put into a dish for the
middle of the table, and put on the cream a froth
like the above, which may be made of raspberry or
currantjelly.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Another way.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Scald a codlin before it is ripe, or any sharp apple,
and pulpit through a sieve. Beat the whites of two
<span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>eggs with sugar, and a spoonful of orange flower
water; mix in by degrees the pulp, and beat all
together until you have a large quantity of froth.
Serve it on a raspberry cream; or you may colour
the froth with beetroot, raspberry, or currantjelly,
and set it on a white cream, having given it the
flavour of lemon, sugar, and wine as above; or,
put the froth on a custard.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Everlasting, or Solid Syllabubs.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Mix a quart of thick raw cream, one pound of
refined sugar, a pint of white, and half a pint of
sweet wine in a deep pan: put to it the grated peel
and the juice of three lemons. Beat, or whisk it
one way half an hour, then put it into glasses.</p>

<p class='c010'>It will keep good, in a cool place, ten days.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Yellow Lemon Cream, without Cream.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Pare four lemons very thin into twelve large
spoonfuls of water, and squeeze the juice on seven
ounces of finely pounded sugar: beat the yelks of
nine eggs <i>well</i>; add the peels and juice beaten together
for some time; then strain it through a
flannel into silver or very nice blocktin saucepan;
set it over a gentle fire, and stir it one way till
pretty thick, and scalding hot, but not boiling, or it
will curdle. Pour it into jelly glasses. A few lumps
of sugar should be rubbed hard on the lemons before
they are pared, or after, as the peel will be so
thin as not to take all the essence, and the sugar
will attract it, and give better colour and flavour.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>
  <h3 class='c013'><i>White ditto</i></h3>
</div>

<p class='c014'>Is made the same as the above; only put the
whites of the eggs instead of the yelks, whisking
it extremely well to froth.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Lemon Cream.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Take a pint of thick cream, and put to it the yelks
of two eggs well beaten, four ounces of fine sugar,
and the thin rind of a lemon: boil it up, then stir
it till almost cold. Put the juice of a lemon in a
dish or bowl, and pour the cream upon it, stirring
it till quite cold.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>An excellent Cream.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Whip up three quarters of a pint of very rich
cream to a strong froth, with some finely scraped
lemonpeel, a squeeze of the juice, half a glass of
sweet wine, and sugar to make it pleasant but not
too sweet. Lay it on a sieve or in a form, and next
day put it on a dish, and ornament it with very
light puff paste biscuit, made in tin shapes the
length of a finger, and about two thick, over which
sugar may be strewed, or a light glaze with isinglass.
Or you may use macaroons.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Blancmange or Blamange.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Boil two ounces of isinglass in three half pints of
water half an hour; strain it to a pint and half of
cream; sweeten it, and add some peachwater, or
a few bitter almonds; let it boil once up, and put it
into what forms you please. If not to be very stiff,
a little less isinglass will do. Observe to let the
blamange settle before you turn it into the forms,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>or the blacks will remain at the bottom of them,
and be on the top of the blamange when taken out
of the moulds.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Dutch Flummery.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Boil two ounces of isinglass in three half pints of
water very gently half an hour: add a pint of white
wine, the juice of three and the thin rind of one
lemon, and rub a few lumps of sugar on another
lemon to obtain the essence; and with them add as
much more sugar as shall make it sweet enough.
Having beaten the yelks of seven eggs, give them
and the above, when mixed, one scald; stir all the
time, and pour it into a bason. Stir it till half cold,
then let it settle, and put it into a melon shape.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Calf’s Feet Jelly.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Boil two feet in five pints of water till the feet
are broken, and the water half wasted: strain it,
and, when cold, take off the fat, and remove the
<i>jelly</i> from the sediment; then put it into a saucepan,
with sugar, raisin wine, lemonjuice to your
taste, and some lemonpeel. When the flavour is
rich, put to it the whites of five eggs well beaten,
and their shells are broken. Set the saucepan on the
fire, but do not stir the jelly after it begins to warm.
Let it boil twenty minutes after it rises to a head,
then pour it through a flannel jellybag; first dipping
the bag in hot water to prevent waste, and
squeezing it quite dry. Run the jelly through
and through until clear; then put it into glasses or
forms.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span>Observe, that the feet for <i>all</i> jellies should be
only scalded to take off the hair; not bought boiled,
which is the usual way; but the following mode
will greatly facilitate the clearing of jelly: when the
mixture has boiled twenty minutes, throw in a teacupful
of cold water; let it boil five minutes longer;
then take the saucepan off the fire, cover it close,
and keep it half an hour: after which, it will be so
clear as to need only once running through the
bag, and much waste will be saved.</p>

<p class='c010'>Observe, feet for all jellies are boiled so long by
the people who sell them, that the nutritious juices
are lessened; they should be only scalded to take
off the hair. The liquor will require greater care
in removing the fat; but the jelly will be far
stronger, and, of course, allow more water.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Another sort.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Boil four quarts of water with three calf’s feet
that have been only scalded, till half wasted: take
the jelly from the fat and sediment: mix with it
the juice of a Seville orange, and twelve lemons,
the peels of three, the whites and shells of twelve
eggs; brown sugar to taste, near a pint of raisin
wine, one ounce of coriander seed, a quarter of an
ounce of allspice, a bit of cinnamon, and six cloves,
all bruised, after having previously mixed them
cold. The jelly should boil fifteen minutes without
stirring; then clear it through a flannel bag.
While running take a little jelly, and mix with a
teacupful of water in which a bit of beetroot has
been boiled, and run it through the bag when all
<span class='pageno' id='Page_167'>167</span>the rest is run out; and this is to garnish the other
jelly, being cooled on a plate; but this is matter
of choice.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Orange jelly.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Grate the rind of two Seville and two China
oranges, and two lemons; squeeze the juice of
three of each, and strain, and add the juice to a
quarter of a pound of lump sugar, and a quarter of
a pint of water, and boil till it almost candies. Have
ready a quart of isinglassjelly made with two
ounces, put to it the syrup, and boil it once up;
strain off the jelly, and let it stand to settle as above
before it be put into the mould.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Hartshornjelly.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Simmer eight ounces of hartshorn shavings with
two quarts of water to one; strain it, and boil it
with the rinds of four China oranges and two lemons
pared thin; when cool, add the juice of both, half a
pound of sugar, and the whites of six eggs beaten
to a froth; let the jelly have three or four boils
without stirring, and strain it through a jellybag.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Imperial Cream.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Boil a quart of cream with the thin rind of a
lemon, then stir it till nearly cold; have ready in a
dish or bowl that you are to serve in, the juice of
three lemons strained with as much sugar as will
sweeten the cream; which pours into the dish from
a large teapot, holding it high, and moving it about
<span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>to mix with the juice. It should be made at least
six hours before it be served.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>A Cream.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Boil half a pint of cream, and half a pint of milk,
with two bayleaves, a bit of lemonpeel, a few almonds
beaten to paste, with a drop of water, a little
sugar, orange flower water, and a teaspoonful of
flour, having been rubbed down with a little cold
milk, and mixed with the above. When cold, put
a little lemonjuice to the cream, and serve it in
cups or lemonade glasses.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Cheap, and excellent Custards.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Boil three pints of new milk, with a bit of lemonpeel,
a bit of cinnamon, two or three bayleaves,
and sweeten it. Meanwhile, rub down smooth a
large spoonful of rice flour into a cup of cold milk,
and mix with it two yelks of egg well beaten. Take
a bason of the boiling milk, and mix with the cold,
and then pour that to the boiling; stirring it one
way, till it begins to thicken, and is just going to
boil up; then pour it into a pan, stir it some time,
add a large spoonful of peachwater, two teaspoonfuls
of brandy, or a little ratafia.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Richer Custard.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Boil a pint of milk with lemonpeel and cinnamon;
mix a pint of cream, and the yelks of five
eggs well beaten. When the milk tastes of the
seasoning, sweeten it enough for the whole, pour
it into the cream, stirring well, then give the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_169'>169</span>custard a simmer till of proper thickness. Do
not let it boil. Stir the whole time one way:
season as above.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Almond Cream.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Beat four ounces of sweet almonds, and a few
bitter, in a mortar, with a teaspoonful of water to
prevent oiling, both having been blanched. Put
the paste to a quart of cream, and add the juice of
three lemons sweetened; beat it up with a whisk
to a froth, which takes off on the shallow part of a
sieve. Fill glasses with some of the liquor and
the froth.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Brandy Cream.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Boil two dozen of almonds blanched, and pounded
bitter almonds in a little milk. When cold, add it
to the yelks of five eggs beaten well in a little
cream; sweeten, and put to it two glasses of best
brandy; and when well mixed, pour to it a quart
of thin cream. Set it over the fire, but do not let
it boil. Stir one way till it thickens, then pour into
cups, or low glasses. When cold it will be ready.
A ratafia drop may be put in each, if you choose
it. If you wish it to keep, scald the cream previously.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Snow Cream.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Put to a quart of cream the whites of three eggs
well beaten, four spoonfuls of sweet wine, sugar to
your taste, and a bit of lemonpeel: whip it to a
froth, remove the peel, and serve in a dish.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>A pretty Supper dish.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Boil a teacupful of rice, having first washed it
in milk, till tender: strain off the milk; lay the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_170'>170</span>rice in little heaps on a dish; strew over them
some finely powdered sugar and cinnamon, and
put warm wine and a little butter into the dish.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Wine Roll.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Soak a penny French roll in raisin wine till it
will hold no more: put it in the dish, and pour
round it a custard, or cream, sugar, and lemonjuice.
Just before it is served, sprinkle over it some nonpareil
comfits; or stick a few blanched and slit
almonds into it.</p>

<p class='c010'>Sponge biscuit may be used instead of the roll.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>An excellent Trifle.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Lay macaroons and ratafia drops over the bottom
of your dish, and pour in as much raisin wine
as they will suck up; which, when they have done,
pour on them cold rich custard, made with more
eggs than directed in the foregoing pages, and some
rice flour. It must stand two or three inches thick.
On that put a layer of raspberry jam, and cover
the whole with a very high whip made the day
before, of rich cream, the whites of two well beaten
eggs, sugar, lemonpeel, and raisin wine. If made
the day before used, it has quite a different taste,
and is solid and far better.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Burnt Cream.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Boil a pint of cream with a stick of cinnamon,
and some lemonpeel; take it off the fire, and pour
it very slowly into the yelks of four eggs, stirring
till half cold: sweeten, and take out the spice, &#38;c.
Pour it into the dish; when cold, strew white
<span class='pageno' id='Page_171'>171</span>pounded sugar over, and brown it with a salamander.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Rice and Sago Milks</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Are made by washing the seeds nicely, and over
a slow fire simmering with milk till sufficiently
done. The former sort requires lemon, spice
and sugar; the latter is fine without anything to
flavour it.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Lemon Honeycomb.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Sweeten the juice of a lemon to your taste, and
put it in the dish that you serve it in. Mix the
white of an egg that is beaten with a pint of rich
cream, and a little sugar; whisk it, and as the
froth rises put it on the lemonjuice.</p>

<p class='c010'>Do it the day before it is to be used.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Coffee Cream. Much admired.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Boil a calf’s foot in water till it wastes to a pint
of jelly: clear it of sediment and fat. Make a teacup
of very strong coffee; clear it with a bit of isinglass
to be perfectly bright; pour it to the jelly,
and add a pint of very good cream, and as much
fine Lisbon sugar as is pleasant. Give one boil
up, and pour into the dish. It should jelly, but
not be stiff. Observe that your coffee be fresh.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Orange Fool.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Mix the juice of three Seville oranges, three
eggs well beaten, a pint of cream, a little nutmeg
and cinnamon, and sweeten to your taste. Set the
whole over a slow fire, and stir it till it becomes as
thick as good melted butter, but it must not be
boiled; then pour it into a dish for eating cold.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span>
  <h3 class='c013'><i>Gooseberry Fool.</i></h3>
</div>

<p class='c014'>Put the fruit into a stonejar and some good
Lisbon sugar with them: set the jar on a stove,
or in a saucepan of water over the fire; if the former,
a large spoonful of water should be added to
the fruit. When it is done enough to pulp, press
it through a colander: have ready a sufficient
quantity of new milk, and a teacup of raw cream
boiled together; or an egg instead of the latter,
and left to be cold; then sweeten it pretty well
with fine Lisbon sugar, and mix the pulp by degrees,
with it.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Apple Fool.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Stew apples as directed for gooseberries, and
then peel and pulp them. Prepare the milk, &#38;c.
and mix as before.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Raspberry Cream.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Mash the fruit gently, and let them drain; then
sprinkle a little sugar over, and that will produce
more juice; then put the juice to some cream, and
sweeten it. After which, if you choose to lower it
with some milk, it will not curdle; which it would,
if put to the milk before the cream; but it is best
made of raspberry jelly, instead of jam, when the
fresh fruit cannot be obtained.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Flummery.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Put three large handfuls of very small white oatmeal
to steep a day and night in cold water; then pour
it off clear, and add as much more water, and let it
stand the same time. Strain it through a fine hair
sieve, and boil it till it be as thick as hasty pudding;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_173'>173</span>stirring it well all the time. When first strained,
put to it one large spoonful of white sugar, and
two of orange flower water. Put it into shallow
dishes; and serve to eat with wine, cyder,
milk, or cream and sugar. It is very good.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>To butter Oranges.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Grate off a little of the outside rind of four Seville
oranges, and cut a round hole, at the blunt
the end opposite the stalk, large enough to take out
the pulp, seeds, and juice; then pick the seeds
and skin from the pulp. Rub the oranges with a
little salt, and lay them in water for a short time.
You are to save the bits cut out. Set the fruit
on to boil in fresh water till they are tender, shifting
the water to take out the bitterness. In the
mean time, make a thin syrup with fine sugar, and
put the oranges into it, and boil them up, turning
them round, that each part may partake of the
syrup, as there need not be enough to cover them,
and let them remain in it hot till they are to be
served. About half an hour before you want them,
put some sugar to the pulp, and set over the fire;
mix it well, and let it boil; then add a spoonful of
white wine for every orange. Give it a boil, and
then put in a bit of fresh butter, and stir it over
the fire to thicken. Fill the oranges with it, and
serve them with some of the syrup in the dish.
Put the bits on the top.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Buttered Orange Juice.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Mix the juice of seven Seville oranges with four
spoonfuls of rose water, and add the whole to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_174'>174</span>yelks of eight and whites of four eggs, well beaten.
Then strain the liquor to half a pound of sugar
pounded; stir it over a gentle fire, and when it begins
to thicken, put about the size of a small walnut
of butter: keep it over the fire a few minutes
longer, then pour it into a flat dish, and serve it to
eat cold.</p>

<p class='c010'>If you have no silver saucepan, do it in a Chinabason
in a saucepan of boiling water, the top of
which will just receive the bason.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Stewed Pears.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Pare and halve, or quarter, large pears, according
to their size: throw them into water, as the skin is
taken off before they are divided, to prevent their
turning black. Pack them round a blocktin stewpan,
and sprinkle as much sugar over as will make
them pretty sweet: add lemonpeel, a clove or two,
and some allspice cracked. Just cover them with
water, and put some of the red liquor which will
be directed hereafter; cover them close, and stew
three or four hours. When tender, take them out,
and pour the liquor over them.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Baked Pears.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>These need not be of a fine sort; but some taste
better than others, and often those that are least fit
to eat raw. Wipe, but do not pare, and lay them on
tin plates, and bake them in a slow oven. When
baked enough to bear it, flatten them with a silver
spoon. When done through, put them on a dish.</p>

<p class='c010'>Apples in the same way are excellent, and serve
for desserts.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_175'>175</span>
  <h3 class='c013'><i>Dried Apples, or Pears.</i></h3>
</div>

<p class='c014'>Put them in a cool oven six or seven times, and
flatten them by degrees, and gently, when soft
enough to bear it. If the oven be too hot they will
waste; and at first it should be very cool.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Biffin, the Minshul crab, or any tart apples,
are the sort for drying.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Black Caps.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Halve and core some fine large apples: put them
in a shallow pan: strew white sugar over, and bake
them. Boil a glass of wine, the same of water, and
sweeten it for sauce.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Stewed Golden Pippins.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Scoop out the core; pare them very thin; and
as you do it, throw them in water. For every
pound of fruit make half a pound of single refined
sugar into syrup, with a pint of water. When
skimmed, put the pippins in, and stew till clear;
then grate lemon over, and serve in the syrup. Be
careful not to let them break.</p>

<p class='c010'>They are an elegant and good dish for a corner
or dessert.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Red Apples in Jelly.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Pare and core some well shaped apples; pippins,
or golden rennets, if you have them, but others
will do: throw them into water as you do them.
Put them in a preserving pan, and with as little
water as will only half cover them, let them coddle;
and when the lower side is done, turn them. Observe
that they do not lie too close when first put in. Mix
<span class='pageno' id='Page_176'>176</span>some pounded cochineal with the water, and boil
with the fruit. When sufficiently done, take them
out on the dish they are to be served in, the stalk
downwards. Take the water, and make a rich
jelly of it with loaf sugar, boiling the thin rind and
juice of a lemon. When coming to a jelly, let it
grow cold, and put it on and among the apples, and
cut the peel of the lemon in narrow strips, and put
across the eye of the apple.</p>

<p class='c010'>Observe that the colour be fine from the first, or
the fruit will not afterward gain it.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Apple jelly, to serve to table.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Prepare twenty golden pippins: boil them in a
pint and a half of water from the spring, till quite
tender; then strain the liquor through a colander.
To every pint put a pound of fine sugar; add grated
orange or lemon, then boil to a jelly.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Another.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Prepare apples as before, by boiling and straining:
have ready half an ounce of isinglass, boiled
in half a pint of water to a jelly: put this to the
apple water, and apple as strained through a coarse
sieve: add sugar, a little lemonjuice, and peel. Boil
all together, and put into a dish. Take out the
peel.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>To prepare Apples for Puffs.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Pare and core apples; cover them with water,
but put them as close as possible, that they may
take but little: add a little pounded cinnamon and
a clove; to every dozen apples two spoonfuls of
rosewater, and a little lemonpeel finely shred.
Sweeten and cool before you make it into puffs.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_177'>177</span>
  <h3 class='c013'><i>Pippin Tarts.</i></h3>
</div>

<p class='c014'>Pare thin two Seville or China oranges; boil the
peel tender, and shred it fine. Pare and core twenty
apples; put them in a stewpan, and as little
water as possible; when half done, add half a
pound of sugar, the orangepeel and juice: boil till
pretty thick. When cold, put it in a shallow dish,
or pattypans lined with paste, to turn out, and be
eaten cold.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Apple Marmalade.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Scald apples till they will pulp from the core;
then take an equal weight of sugar in large lumps,
just dip them in water, and boiling it till it can be
well skimmed, and is a thick syrup; put to it the
pulp, and simmer it on a quick fire a quarter of an
hour.</p>

<p class='c010'>Keep it in small pots, covered with paper dipped
in brandy.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Codlins to scald.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Wrap each in a vine leaf, and pack them close in
a nice saucepan; and, when full, pour as much
water as will cover them. Set it over a gentle fire,
and let them simmer slowly till done enough to
take the thin skin off when cold. Place them in a
dish, with or without milk, cream, or custard; if
the latter, there should be no ratafia. Dust fine
sugar over the apples.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Different ways of dressing Cranberries.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>For pies and puddings, with a good deal of sugar.</p>

<p class='c010'>Stewed in a jar, with the same; which way they
eat well with bread, and are very wholesome.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_178'>178</span>Thus done, pressed and strained, the juice makes
a fine drink for people in fevers.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Cranberry jelly.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Make a very strong isinglassjelly. When cold,
mix it with a double quantity of cranberry juice
pressed as above: sweeten and boil it up; then
strain it into a shape.</p>

<p class='c010'>The sugar must be good loaf, or the jelly will
not be clear.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Cranberry and Rice jelly.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Boil and press the fruit: strain the juice; and
by degrees mix into it as much ground rice as will,
when boiled, thicken to a jelly. Boil it gently,
stirring it, and sweeten to your taste. Put it into
a bason or form, and serve to eat as the before
directed jelly, with milk or cream.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Prune Tart.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Give prunes a scald: take out the stones and
break them: put the kernels into a little cranberry
juice, with the prunes and sugar; simmer, and
when cold, make a tart of the sweetmeat.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>To fill preserved Oranges. Corner dish.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>For five, take a pound of Naples biscuit, some
blanched almonds, the yelks of four eggs beaten,
sugar to your taste, four ounces of butter warmed:
grate the biscuit, and mix with the above, and
some orange flower water. Fill preserved oranges,
and bake in a very slow oven. If you like them
frosted, sift sugar over them as soon as filled;
otherwise wipe them. Custard to fill will do
<span class='pageno' id='Page_179'>179</span>as well; if so, you need not bake the oranges, but
put in cold.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Orange Tart.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Squeeze, pulp, and boil two Seville oranges tender:
weigh them, and double of sugar; beat both
together to a paste, and then add the juice and pulp
of the fruit, and the size of a walnut of fresh butter,
and beat all together. Choose a very shallow dish,
line it with a light puff crust, and lay the paste of
orange in it. You may ice it. See <i>Paste</i>.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Codlin Tart.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Scald the fruit, as directed under that article;
when ready, take off the thin skin, and lay them
whole in a dish, put a <i>little</i> of the water that the
apples were boiled in at bottom, and strew them
over with lump sugar or fine Lisbon; when cold,
put a paste round the edges, and over.</p>

<p class='c010'>You may wet it with white of egg, and strew
sugar over, which looks well: or, cut the lid in
quarters, without touching the paste on the edge of
the dish; and either put the broad end downwards,
and make the point stand up, or remove the lid
altogether. Pour a good custard over it; when
cold, sift sugar over it.</p>

<p class='c010'>Or line the bottom of a shallow dish with paste,
lay the apples in it, put sugar over, and lay little
twists of paste over in bars.</p>

  <h3 class='c013'><i>Rhubarb Tart.</i></h3>
</div>

<p class='c014'>Cut the stalks in lengths of four or five inches,
and take off the thin skin. If you have a hot hearth,

<h3 class='c013'><i>Applepie.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Pare and core the fruit, having wiped the outside;
which, with the cores, boil with a little water
till it tastes well. Strain, and put a little sugar,
and a bit of bruised cinnamon, and simmer again.
In the mean time place the apples in a dish, a paste
being put round the edge; when one layer is in,
sprinkle half the sugar, and shred lemonpeel, and
squeeze some juice, or a glass of cyder; if the apples
have lost their spirit, put in the rest of the
apples, sugar, and the liquor that you have boiled.
Cover with paste. You may add some butter when
cut, if eaten hot: or put quince marmalade, orange
paste, or cloves to flavour.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Puffs of any sort of Fruit</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>May be made, but it should be prepared first
with sugar. Apples will do, as before directed;
or, as follows, eat best: the crust must be thick, if
used raw. Pare and slice apple; sprinkle sugar,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_181'>181</span>and some chopped lemon: or stew in a small stonejar.
When cold, make it into puffs of thin crust.</p>

nutmeg. Set all in a saucepan, just to thicken,
over the fire; then put into a dish, lined with paste
to turn out, and bake it.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Pancakes of Rice.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Boil half a pound of rice to a jelly in a small
quantity of water: when cold, mix it with a pint of
cream, eight eggs, a bit of salt, and nutmeg. Stir
in eight ounces of butter just warmed, and add as

<h3 class='c013'><i>Common Pancakes.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Make a light batter of eggs, flour, and milk.
Fry in a small pan, in hot dripping or lard. Salt,
or nutmeg and ginger may be added.</p>

<p class='c010'>Sugar and lemons should be served to eat with
them. Or, when eggs are scarce, make the batter
with flour, and small beer, ginger, &#38;c. Or clean
snow, with flour, and a very little milk, will serve
as well as eggs.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Irish Pancakes.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Beat eight yelks and four whites of eggs: strain
them into a pint of cream; put a grated nutmeg
and sugar to your taste. Set three ounces of fresh

<p class='c014'>Beat six fresh eggs extremely well; mix, when
strained, with a pint of cream, four ounces of sugar,
a glass of wine, half a nutmeg grated, and as much

pancake batter, but not quite. Heat the fryingpan
tolerably hot, wipe it with a clean cloth; then pour
in the batter, to make thin pancakes.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Bockings.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Mix three ounces of buckwheat flour, with a

<p class='c014'>Cut streaked bacon in thin slices an inch long:
make a batter of a pint of milk, three eggs, and a
large spoonful of flour; add salt and pepper: put a
piece of fresh dripping in the pan, and, when hot,

pancakes by dropping a small quantity into the pan.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_183'>183</span>Or make the plainer sort, and put pared apple,
sliced and cored, into the batter, and fry some of
it with each slice. Currants, or sliced lemon as
thin as paper, make an agreeable change.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Spanish Fritters.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Cut the crumb of a French roll into lengths, as
thick as your finger, in what shape you will. Soak

beat four yelks and three whites of eggs, and add
to the above, with one large spoonful of cream,
another of sweet wine, a squeeze of lemon, and a

least. It will be extremely light. Put a good
quantity of fine lard in a stewpan, and drop a spoonful
of the batter at a time into it: fry them; and
serve as a sauce, a glass of white wine, the juice
of a lemon, one dessert spoonful of peachleaf, or

only you must boil the peel in two or three waters
to take out the bitterness.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Orange Cheesecakes.</i></h3>

beat them very fine, with orange flower
water, and half a pound of fine sugar beaten and

cold. Put crust in pattypans, and rather more
than half fill them. Bake in a quick oven half an

<p class='c014'>Blanch and pound four ounces of almonds, and
a few bitter, with a spoonful of water; then add
four ounces of sugar pounded, a spoonful of cream,
and the whites of two eggs well beaten. Mix all
as quick as possible; put into very small pattypans,
and bake in a pretty warm oven under twenty
minutes.</p>

  <h2 class='c006'>FRUITS, TO KEEP.</h2>
</div>

<h3 class='c011'><i>Oranges or Lemons, for Puddings, &#38;c.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>When you squeeze the fruits, throw the outside
in water without the pulp. Let them remain in
the same a fortnight, adding no more. Boil them
therein till tender; strain it from them, and when
they are tolerably dry, throw them into any old jar
of candy, you may have remaining from old sweetmeats;
or if you have none, boil a small quantity
of syrup of common loaf sugar and water, and put
over them. In a week or ten days boil them gently
in it till they look clear, and that they may be
covered with it in the jar. You may cut each half
of the fruit in two, and they will occupy small
space.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>To preserve Gooseberries.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Before they become too large, let them be gathered;
and take care not to cut them in taking off
the stalks and buds. Fill wide mouthed bottles;
put the corks loosely in, and set the bottles up to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_187'>187</span>the neck in water in a boiler. When the fruit
looks scalded, take them out; and when perfectly
cold, cork close, and rosin the top. Dig a trench
in a part of the garden least used, sufficiently deep
for all the bottles to stand, and the earth be thrown
over, to cover them a foot and a half. When a
frost comes on, a little fresh litter from the stable
will prevent the ground from hardening, so that the
fruit cannot be dug up. Or, scald as above; when
cold, fill the bottles with cold water; cork them,
and keep them in a damp, or dry place: they will
not be spoiled.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Another way.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>In the size and preparation as above. When
done, have boiling water ready, either in a boiler
or large kettle, and into it put as much rock alum
as will, when dissolved, harden the water, which
you will taste by a <i>little</i> roughness: if there be too
much it will spoil the fruit. Put as many gooseberries
into a large sieve as will lie at the bottom
without covering one another. Hold the sieve in
the water till the fruit begins to look scalded on the
outside: then turn them gently out of the sieve on
a cloth on the dresser: cover them with another
cloth, and put some more to be scalded; and so on
till all shall be finished. Observe not to put one
quantity on another, or they will become too soft.
The next day pick out any bad or broken ones,
bottle the rest, and fill up the bottles with the alum
water in which they were scalded: which must be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_188'>188</span>kept in the bottles; for if left in the kettle, or in a
glazed pan, it will spoil. Stop them close.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Note.</i> The water must boil all the time the
process is carrying on. Gooseberries, done this
way, make as fine tarts as fresh off the trees.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Another way.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>In dry weather pick the gooseberries that are
full grown, but not ripe: top and tail them, and put
into open mouthed bottles. Gently cork them with
new velvet corks; put them in the oven when the
bread is drawn, and let them stand till shrunk a
quarter part: take them out of the oven, and immediately
beat the corks in tight: cut off the tops,
and rosin down close. Set them in a dry place;
and if well secured from air they will keep the
year round.</p>

<p class='c010'>If gathered in the damp, or the gooseberries’
skins are the least cut in taking off the stalks and
buds, they will mould.</p>

<p class='c010'>Currants and damsons may be done the same.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>To keep Currants.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>The bottles being perfectly clean and dry, let the
currants be cut from the large stalks with the
smallest bit of stalk to each, that, the fruit not being
wounded, no moisture may be among them.
It is necessary to gather them when the weather
is quite dry; and if the servant can be depended
upon, it is best to cut them under the trees, and let
them drop gently into the bottles.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_189'>189</span>Stop up the bottles with cork and rosin, and put
them into the trench in the garden with the neck
downwards. Sticks should be placed opposite to
where each sort of fruit begins.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Note.</i> The directions for gooseberries in case
of frost.</p>

<p class='c010'>Cherries and damsons keep in the same way.</p>

<p class='c010'>Currants may be scalded, and kept with or without
sugar, as directed for gooseberries.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>To keep Codlins for several months.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Gather codlins at Midsummer of a middling
size: put them into an earthen pan: pour boiling
water over them, and cover the pan with cabbage-leaves.
Keep them by the fire till they would
peel, but do not peel them; then pour the water
off till both are quite cold. Place the codlins then
in a stonejar with a smallish mouth, and pour on
them the water that scalded them. Cover the pot
with bladder wetted, and tied very close, and then
over it coarse paper tied again.</p>

<p class='c010'>It is best to keep them in small jars, such as will
be used at once when opened.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>To keep Damsons for winter Pies.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Put them in small stonejars, or wide mouthed
bottles: set them up to their necks in a boiler of
cold water, and lighting a fire under, scald them.
Next day, when perfectly cold, fill up with spring
water. Cover them.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Another way.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Boil one third as much sugar as fruit with it, over
a slow fire, till the juice adheres to the fruit, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_190'>190</span>forms a jam. Keep it in small jars in a dry place.
If too sweet, mix with it some of the fruit that is
done without sugar.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Another way.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Choose steep pots if you can get them, which are
of equal size top and bottom (they should hold
eight or nine pounds): put the fruit in about a quarter
up, then strew in a quarter of the sugar, then
another quantity of fruit, and so till all of both are
in. The proportion of sugar is to be three pounds
to nine pounds of fruit. Set the jars in the oven,
and bake the fruit quite through. When cold, put
a piece of clean scraped stick into the middle of the
jar, and let the upper part stand above the top;
then pour melted mutton suet over the top, full half
an inch thick, having previously covered the fruit
with white paper. Keep the jars in a cold dry place,
and use the suet as a cover, which you will draw
up by the stick; minding to leave a little forked
branch to it to prevent its slipping out.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Observations on Sweetmeats.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Sweetmeats should be kept in a very dry place.
Unless they have a very small proportion of sugar,
a warm one does not hurt; but when not properly
boiled, that is, long enough, but not quick, heat
makes them ferment, and damp causes them to grow
mouldy. They should be looked at two or three
times in the first two months, that they may be
gently boiled again, if not likely to keep.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_191'>191</span>It is necessary to observe, that sugar being boiled
more or less, constitutes the chief art of the confectioner;
and those who are not practised in this knowledge,
and only preserve in a plain way for family
use, are not aware that, in two or three minutes, a
syrup over the fire will pass from one gradation to
another, called, by the confectioners, degrees of
boiling, of which there are six, and those subdivided.
But I am not versed in the minutia; and only make
the observation to guard against under boiling,
which prevents sweetmeats from keeping; and
quick boiling and long, which brings them to candy.</p>

<p class='c010'>Attention, without much practice, will enable a
person to do any of the following sorts of sweetmeats,
&#38;c. and they are as much as is wanted in a
private family; and the higher articles of preserved
fruits may be bought at less expense than made.</p>

<p class='c010'>A pan should be kept for the purpose of preserving,
of double blocktin. A bow handle opposite
the straight one, for safety, will do very well; and,
if put by nicely cleaned, in a dry place, when done
with, will last for several years. Those of copper
or brass are improper, as the tinning wears out by
the scraping of the sweetmeat ladle. There is a
new sort of iron, with a strong tinning, which promises
to wear long. Sieves and spoons should be
kept likewise for sweet things.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>To clarify Sugar.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Break as much as required in large lumps, and
put a pound to half a pint of water, in a bowl, and
it will dissolve better than when broken small. Set
<span class='pageno' id='Page_192'>192</span>it over the fire, and the well whipt white of an egg:
let it boil up, and, when ready to run over, pour a
little cold water in it to give it a check; but when
it rises a second time, take it off the fire, and set it
by in the pan for a quarter of an hour: during
which time the foulness will sink to the bottom, and
leave a black scum on the top; which take off
gently with a skimmer, and pour the syrup into a
vessel very quickly from the sediment.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>To dry Cherries, with Sugar.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Stone six pounds of Kentish; put them into a
preservingpan, with two pounds of loaf sugar
pounded and strewed among them: simmer till
they begin to shrivel, then strain them from the
juice; lay them on a hot hearth, or in an oven,
when either are cool enough to dry without baking
them.</p>

<p class='c010'>The same syrup will do another six pounds of
fruit.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>To dry Cherries without Sugar.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Stone and set them over the fire in the preservingpan:
let them simmer in their own liquor, and
shake them in the pan. Put them by in China
common dishes. Next day give them another
scald, and put them, when cold, on sieves to dry,
in an oven of at tempered heat as above. Twice
heating, an hour each time, will do them.</p>

<p class='c010'>Put them in a box, with a paper between each
layer.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_193'>193</span>
  <h3 class='c013'><i>Excellent Sweetmeats for Tarts, when Fruit is plentiful.</i></h3>
</div>

<p class='c014'>Divide two pounds of apricots when just ripe, and
take out and break the stones. Put the kernels
without their skins to the fruit: add to it three
pounds of green gage plums, and two pounds
and a half of lump sugar. Simmer until the fruit
be a clear jam. The sugar should be broken in
large pieces, and just dipped in water, and added
to the fruit over a slow fire. Observe that it does
not boil, and skim it well. If the sugar be clarified
it will make the jam better.</p>

<p class='c010'>Put it into small pots; in which, all sweetmeats
keep best.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Currantjelly, red or black.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Strip the fruit, and in a stonejar stew them in
a saucepan of water, or by boiling it on the hot
hearth; strain off the liquor, and to every pint
weigh a pound of loaf sugar. Put the latter in
large lumps into it, in a stone or China vessel, till
nearly dissolved; then put it in a preservingpan.
Simmer and skim as necessary. When it will jelly
on plate, put it in small jars or glasses.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Raspberry Jam.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Weigh equal quantities of fruit and sugar. Put
the former into a preservingpan; boil and break
it; stir constantly, and let it boil very quickly.
When most of the juice is wasted, add the sugar,
and simmer to a fine jam.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_194'>194</span>This way the jam is greatly superior in colour
and flavour to that which is made by putting the sugar
in at first.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Raspberry Jam another way.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Put the fruit in a jar into a kettle of water, or on
a hot hearth, till the juice will run from it; then
take away a quarter of a pint from every pound of
fruit. Boil and bruise it half an hour, then put in
the weight of the fruit in sugar, and, adding the
same quantity of currantjuice, boil it to a strong
jelly.</p>

<p class='c010'>The raspberry juice will serve to put into brandy;
or may be boiled, with its weight in sugar, for making
the jelly for raspberry ice or cream.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Raspberry jelly, for Ices or Creams.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Do the fruit as directed for currantjelly, and
use in the same proportion of sugar and liquor.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Raspberry Cakes.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Pick out any bad raspberries that are among the
fruit: weigh and boil what quantity you please;
and when mashed, and the liquor is wasted, put to
it sugar the weight of the fruit you first put into
the pan. Mix it well <i>off</i> the fire, until perfectly
dissolved; then put it on China plates, and dry it
in the sun. As soon as the top part dries, cut
with the cover of a cannister into small cakes, turn
them on fresh plates, and, when dry, put them in
boxes with layers of paper.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Apricot Cheese.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Weigh an equal quantity of pared fruit and
sugar: wet the latter a very little, and let it boil
<span class='pageno' id='Page_195'>195</span>quickly, or the colour will be spoiled: blanch the
kernels, and add to it. Twenty or thirty minutes
will boil it. Put it in small pots or cups half filled.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Apricots or Peaches in Brandy.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Wipe, weigh, and pick the fruit, and have
ready a quarter of the weight of fine sugar in fine
powder. Put the fruit into an icepot that shuts
very close: throw the sugar over it, and then cover
the fruit with brandy. Between the top and cover
of the pot, put a piece of double cap paper. Set
the pot into a saucepan of water till the brandy be
as hot as you can possibly bear to put your finger
in, but must not boil. Put the fruit into a jar, and
pour the brandy on it. When cold, put a bladder
over, and tie it down tight.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Cherries in Brandy.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Weigh the finest morellas, having cut off half
the stalk: prick them with a new needle, and drop
them into a jar or widemouthed bottle. Pound
three quarters the weight of sugar or white candy:
strew over, fill up with brandy, and tie a bladder
over.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>To prepare Oranges to put into Orange Puddings.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Put twelve Seville oranges in water, and change
them three days. Boil them in the least water till
tender: scoop out the pulp, and pick out the kernels;
then, in a marble mortar, beat the oranges,
then the pulp separately; and, after, both together.
To every pound put a pound and a half of sugar,
pounded and sifted, and beat to a paste. Keep it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_196'>196</span>in small gallipots, and cover with white paper dipped
in brandy.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>To dry Apricots in half.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Pare thin and halve four pounds of apricots,
weighing them after: put them in a dish, and strew
among them three pounds of sugar in the finest
powder. When it melts, set the fruit over a stove
to do very gently. As each piece becomes tender,
take it out and put it into a China bowl. When
all are done, and the boiling heat a little abated,
pour the syrup over them. In a day or two remove
the syrup, leaving only a little in each half.
In a day or two more turn them; and so continue
daily till quite dry, in the sun or a warm place.
Keep in boxes with layers of paper.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>To preserve Apricots in Jelly.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Pare the fruit <i>very</i> thin, and stone it. Weigh
an equal quantity of sugar in fine powder and strew
over it. Next day boil very gently till they are
clear: move them into a bowl, and pour the liquor
over. The following day pour the liquor to a
quart of codlin liquor, made by boiling and straining,
and a pound of fine sugar: let it boil quickly
till it will jelly: put the fruit into it, and give one
boil; and having skimmed well, put into small
pots.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Applejelly for the above, or any sort of Sweetmeats.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Let apples be pared, quartered, and cored: put
them into a stewpan with as much water as will
cover them: boil as fast as possible. When the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_197'>197</span>fruit is all in a mash, add a quart of water: boil
half an hour more, and run through a jellybag.</p>

<p class='c010'>If in summer, codlins are best: in September,
golden rennets or winter pippins.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>To preserve green Apricots.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Lay vine or apricot leaves at the bottom of your
pan, then fruit, and so alternately till full, the upper
layer being thick with leaves; then fill with
spring water, and cover down, that no steam may
come out. Set the pan at a distance from the fire,
that in four or five hours they may be only soft,
but not cracked. Make a thin syrup of some of
the water, and drain the fruit. When both are
cold, put the fruit into the pan and the syrup to it;
put the pan at a proper distance on the fire till the
apricots green, but on no account boil or crack:
remove them very carefully into a pan with the
syrup for two or three days, then pour off as much
of it as will be necessary, and boil with more sugar
to make a rich syrup, and put a little sliced ginger
into it. When cold, and the thin syrup has all
been drained from the fruit, pour the thick over it.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>To preserve Strawberries whole.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Get the finest scarlets before they are too ripe,
with their stalks kept on; lay them separately on
a China dish; beat and sift twice their weight of
doubly refined sugar over them; then bruise a few
ripe strawberries, with their weight of doubly refined
sugar, in a China bason, cover it close, and set
it in a saucepan of boiling water which will just
hold it till the juice comes out and becomes thick;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_198'>198</span>strain it through muslin into a sweetmeat pan, boil
it up and skim it. When cold, put in the strawberries,
set them over a stove till milk warm, then
take the pan off till they are cold, set them on
again, and let them become rather hotter, and so
for several times till they become clear, but the
hottest degree must not come to a boil. When
cold, put them into glasses, and pour the syrup
over.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Another way.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Take equal weight of the fruit and doubly refined
sugar, lay the former in a large dish, and
sprinkle half the sugar in fine powder over; give
a gentle shake to the dish, that the sugar may
touch the under side of the fruit. Next day make
a thin syrup with the remainder of the sugar, and
instead of water, allow one pint of red currant
juice to every three pounds of strawberries; in
this simmer them until sufficiently jellied. Choose
the largest scarlets, or others, when not dead ripe.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Cherry Jam.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>To twelve pounds of Kentish or Duke cherries,
when ripe, weigh one pound of sugar; break the
stones of part and blanch them; then put them to
the fruits and sugar, and boil all gently till the jam
come clear from the pan. Pour it into China plates
to come up dry to table. Keep in boxes with
white paper between.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Orange Marmalade.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Rasp the oranges, cut out the pulp, then boil the
rinds very tender, and beat fine in a marble mortar.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_199'>199</span>Boil three pounds of loaf sugar in a pint of water,
skim it, and add a pound of the rind; boil fast till
the syrup is very thick, but stir it carefully; then
put a pint of the pulp and juice, the seeds having
been removed, and a pint of apple liquor; boil all
gently until well jellied, which it will be in about
half an hour. Put it into small pots.</p>

<p class='c010'>Lemon marmalade do in the same way.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Quince Marmalade.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Pare and quarter quinces, weigh an equal quantity
of sugar; to four pounds of the latter put a
quart of water, boil, and skim, and keep ready
against four pounds of quinces are tolerably tender
by the following mode: lay them into a stonejar,
with a teacup of water at the bottom, and pack
them with a little sugar strewed between; cover
the jar close, and set it on a stove or cool oven,
and let them soften till the colour become red,
then pour the fruit, syrup, and a quart of quince
juice into a preserving pan, and boil all together
till the marmalade be completed, breaking the
lumps of fruit with the preserving ladle.</p>

<p class='c010'>This fruit is so hard, that if it be not done as
above, it requires a great deal of time.</p>

<p class='c010'>N. B. Stewing quinces in a jar, and then squeezing
them through a cheesecloth, is the best method
of obtaining the juice to add as above.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>To dry Cherries; the best way.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>To every five pounds of cherries stoned, weigh
one of sugar doubly refined. Put the fruit into the
preservingpan with <i>very</i> little water, both made
<span class='pageno' id='Page_200'>200</span>scalding hot; take the fruit immediately out and
dry them, put them into the pan again, strewing
the sugar between each layer of cherries; let it
stand to melt, then set the pan on the fire, and
make it scalding hot as before; take it off, and repeat
this thrice with the sugar. Drain them from
the syrup, and lay them singly to dry on dishes,
in the sun or on a stove. When dry, put them
into a sieve, dip it into a pan of cold water, and
draw it instantly out again, and pour them on a
fine soft cloth; dry them, and set them once more
in the hot sun, or on a stove. Keep them in a box,
with layers of white paper, in a dry place.</p>

<p class='c010'>This way is the best to give plumpness to the
fruit, as well as colour and flavour.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Observe.</i> When any sweetmeats are directed
to be dried in the sun or in a stove, it will be best
in private families, where there is not a regular
stove for the purpose, to place them in the sun on
flag stones, which reflect the heat, and place a
garden glass over them to keep insects off: or if
put in an oven, to take care not to let it be too warm,
and watch that they do properly and slowly.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Gooseberry Jam, for Tarts.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Put twelve pounds of the red hairy gooseberries,
when ripe and gathered in dry weather, into a preservingpan
with a pint of currantjuice, drawn as
for jelly; let them boil pretty quick, and beat them
with the spoon; when they begin to break, put to
them six pounds of pure white Lisbon sugar, and
simmer to a jam. It requires long boiling,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_201'>201</span>or will not keep; but is an excellent and reasonable
thing for tarts or puffs. Look at it in two or three
days, and if the syrup and fruit separate, the whole
must be boiled longer. Be careful it does not burn
to the bottom.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Another.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Gather your gooseberries (the clear white or
green sort) when ripe; top and tail, and weigh
them: a pound to three quarters of a pound of fine
sugar, and half a pint of water; boil and skim the
sugar and water, then put the fruit and boil gently
till clear; then break and put into small pots.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>White Gooseberry Jam.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Gather the finest white gooseberries, or green if
you choose, when just ripe; top and tail them. To
each pound put three quarters of a pound of fine
sugar, and half a pint of water. Boil and clarify
the sugar in the water as directed under that article,
then add the fruit; simmer gently till clear,
then break it, and in a few minutes put the jam
into small pots.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Barberries for Tartlets.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Pick barberries, that have no stones, from the
stalks, and to every pound weigh three quarters of
a pound of lump sugar. Put the fruit into a stonejar,
and either set it on a hot hearth or in a saucepan
of water, and let them simmer very slowly till
soft; put them and the sugar into a preservingpan,
and boil them gently fifteen minutes.</p>

<p class='c010'>Use no metal but silver.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_202'>202</span>
  <h3 class='c013'><i>Barberry Drops.</i></h3>
</div>

<p class='c014'>The black tops must be cut off, then roast the
fruit before the fire, till soft enough to pulp with a
silver spoon through a sieve into a China bason;
then set the bason on a saucepan of water, the top
of which will just fit it, or on a hot hearth, and stir
it till it grows thick. When cold, put to every pint
one pound and a half of sugar, the finest doubly
refined, pounded and sifted through a lawn sieve,
which must be covered with fine linen, to prevent
its wasting while sifting. Beat the sugar and juice
together three hours and a half if a large quantity,
but two and a half for less: then drop it on sheets
of white thick paper, the size of the drops sold in
the shops.</p>

<p class='c010'>Some fruit is not so sour, and then less sugar is
necessary. To know if there be enough, mix till
well incorporated, and then drop: if it runs, there
is not enough sugar, and if it is too much it will
be rough. A dry room will suffice to dry them.
No metal must touch the juice but the point of a
knife, just to take the drop off the end of the wooden spoon,
and then as little as possible.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Ginger Drops, a good Stomachic.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Beat two ounces of fresh candied orange in a
mortar, with a little sugar, to a paste; then mix
one ounce of powder of white ginger with one
pound of loaf sugar. Wet the sugar with a little
water, and boil altogether to candy, and drop it
on paper the size of mint drops.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_203'>203</span>
  <h3 class='c013'><i>Peppermint Drops.</i></h3>
</div>

<p class='c014'>Pound and sift four ounces of doubly refined sugar,
beat it with the whites of two eggs till perfectly
smooth; then add sixty drops of oil of peppermint,
beat it well, and drop on white paper, and dry at a
distance from the fire.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Lemon Drops.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Grate three large lemons, with a large piece of
doubly refined sugar; then scrape the sugar into
a plate, add half a teaspoonful of flour, mix well,
and beat it into a light paste with the white of an
egg. Drop it upon white paper, and put them into
a moderate oven on a tinplate.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>A beautiful Red, to stain Jellies, Ices or Cakes.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Boil fifteen grains of cochineal in the finest powder,
with a drachm and a half of cream of tartar, in
half a pint of water, very slowly, half an hour.
Add in boiling a bit of alum the size of a pea. Or
use beetroot sliced, and some liquor poured over.</p>

<p class='c010'>For white, use almonds, finely powdered, with a
little drop of water; or use cream.</p>

<p class='c010'>For yellow, yelks of eggs, or a bit of saffron
steeped in the liquor and squeezed.</p>

<p class='c010'>For green, pound spinach leaves or beet leaves,
express the juice, and boil in a teacupful in a saucepan
of water, to take off the rawness.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Damson Cheese.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Bake or boil the fruit in a stonejar, in a saucepan
of water, or on a hot hearth. Pour off some
of the juice, and to every two pounds of fruit, weigh
half a pound of sugar. Set the fruit over a fire in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_204'>204</span>the pan, let it boil quickly till it begins to look dry;
take out the stones and add the sugar, stir it well
in, and simmer two hours slowly, then boil it
quickly half an hour, till the sides of the pan candy;
pour the jam then into potting pans or dishes,
about an inch thick, so that it may cut firm. If
the skins be disliked, then the juice is not to be
taken out; but after the first process, the fruit is to
be pulped through a very coarse sieve with the
juice, and managed as above. The stones are to
be cracked, or some of them, and the kernels boiled
in the jam. All the juice may be left in and
boiled to evaporate, but do not add the sugar until
it has done so. The above looks well in shapes.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Biscuit of Fruit.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>To the pulp of any scalded fruit, put equal weight
of sugar sifted, beat it for two hours, then put it into
little white paper forms: dry in a cool oven, turn
the next day, and in two or three days box them.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Magnum Bonum Plums. Excellent as a Sweetmeat, or in Tarts, though very bad to eat raw.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Prick them with a needle, to prevent bursting,
simmer them very gently in a thin syrup; put them
in a China bowl, and when cold pour it over. Let
them lie three days; then make a syrup of three
pounds of sugar to five of fruit, with no more water
than hangs to large lumps of the sugar dipped
quickly, and instantly brought out. Boil the plums
in this fresh syrup, after draining the first from
them. Do them very gently till they are clear,
and the syrup adheres to them. Put them one by
one into small pots, and pour the liquor over.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_205'>205</span>Those you may like to dry, keep a little of the
syrup for, longer in the pan, and boil it quickly,
then give the fruit one more warm: drain, and put
them to dry on plates, in a cool oven. These
plums are apt to ferment, if not boiled in two
syrups; the former will sweeten pies, but will have
too much acid to keep. You may reserve part of
it, and add a little sugar, to do those that are to
dry, for they will not require to be so sweet, as if
kept wet, and will eat very nicely if only boiled as
much as those. Do not break them. One parcel
may be done after another, and save much sugar.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>To preserve Grapes in Brandy.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Put some close bunches, when ripe, but not over
ready, into a jar: strew over them half their weight
in white sugarcandy pounded: prick each grape
once with a needle; fill up with brandy, and tie
close. They look beautifully in a dessert.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Gooseberry Hops.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Of the largest green walnut kind, take and cut
the bud end in four quarters, leaving the stalk end
whole: pick out the seeds, and with a strong needle
and thread, fasten five or six together, by running
the thread through the bottoms, till they are of the
size of a hop. Lay vineleaves at the bottom of a
tin preservingpan: cover them with the hops, then
a layer of leaves, and so on; lay a good many on
the top, then fill the pan with water. Stop it so close
down that no steam can get out: set it by a slow
fire till scalding hot; then take it off till cold, and
do so till on opening while cold, the gooseberries
<span class='pageno' id='Page_206'>206</span>are of a good green. Then drain them on sieves,
and make a thin syrup of a pound of sugar, to a
pint of water, boil, and skim it well; when half
cold, put in the fruit, next day give it one boil; do
this thrice. If the hops are to be dried, which way
they eat best, and look well, they may be set
to dry in a week: but if to be kept wet, make a
syrup in the above proportions, adding a slice of
ginger in boiling; when skimmed and clear, give
the gooseberries one boil, and when cold, pour it
over them. If the first syrup be found too sour, a
little sugar may be added and boiled in it, before
the hops that are for drying, have their last boil.</p>

<p class='c010'>The extra syrup will serve for pies, or go towards
other sweetmeats.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>A Carmel Cover for Sweetmeats.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Dissolve eight ounces of double refined sugar in
three or four spoonfuls of water, and three or four
drops of lemonjuice; then put it into a copper untinned
skellet; when it boils to be thick, dip the
handle of a spoon in it, and put that into a pintbason
of water, squeeze the sugar from the spoon
into it, and so on till you have all the sugar. Take
a bit out of the water, and if it snaps, and is brittle
when cold, it is done enough; but only let it be
three parts cold, when pour the water from the
sugar, and having a copper form oiled well, run
the sugar on it, in the manner of a maze, and when
cold you may put it on the dish it is to cover; but
if on trial the sugar is not brittle, pour off the
water, and return it into the skellet and boil it again.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_207'>207</span>It should look thick like treacle, but of a bright
light gold colour.</p>

<p class='c010'>It is a most elegant cover.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Transparent Marmalade.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Cut the palest Seville oranges in quarters, take
the pulp out, and put it in a bason, pick out the
seeds and skins. Let the outsides soak in water
with a little salt all night, then boil them in a good
quantity of spring water till tender; drain and cut
them in very thin slices, and put them to the pulp;
and to every pound, a pound and a half of double
refined sugar beaten fine; boil them together
twenty minutes, but be careful not to break the
slices. If not quite clear, simmer five or six minutes
longer. It must be stirred all the time very
gently.</p>

<p class='c010'>When cold, put it into glasses.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>To preserve Oranges or Lemons in Jelly.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Cut a hole in the stalk part, the size of a shilling,
and with a blunt small knife scrape out the pulp
quite clear without cutting the rind. Tie each
separately in muslin, and lay them in spring water
two days, changing twice a day; in the last boil
them tender on a slow fire. Observe that there is
enough at first to allow for wasting, as they must
be covered to the last. To every pound of orange,
weigh two pounds of double refined sugar, and one
pint of water; boil the two latter together with the
juice of the orange to a syrup, and clarify it, skim
well, and let it stand to be cold; then boil the fruit
<span class='pageno' id='Page_208'>208</span>in the syrup half an hour; if not clear, do this
daily till they are done.</p>

<p class='c010'>Pare and core some green pippins, and boil in
water till it tastes strong of them; do not break
them, only gently press them with the back of a
spoon. Strain the water through a jellybag till
quite clear; then to every pint put a pound of
double refined sugar, the peel and juice of a lemon,
and boil to a strong syrup. Drain off the syrup
from the fruit, and turning the whole upwards in
the jar, pour the applejelly over it. The bits cut
out must go through the same process with the
fruit. Cover with brandy paper.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Orange Chips.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Cut oranges in halves, squeeze the juice through
a sieve; soak the peel in water, next day boil in
the same till tender, drain them, and slice the peels,
put them to the juice, weigh as much sugar, and
put all together into a broad earthen dish, and put
over the fire at a moderate distance, often stirring
till the chips candy; then set them in a cool room
to dry. They will not be so under three weeks.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Orange Cakes.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Cut Seville oranges in pieces, take out the seeds
and skins, save the juice, and add to the meat of
the fruit, after having beaten it quite fine in a mortar,
in the proportion of a pound to a pound and a
half of loaf sugar finely beaten first. When the
paste is finely mixed, make it into small cakes, and
dry them on China plates in a hot room, and turn
them daily. Do not let them be too dry.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_209'>209</span>They are excellent for gouty stomachs, or for
travellers.</p>

<p class='c010'>The peels of China oranges, soaked a night, then
drained and boiled up in a syrup till enough to be
tender, answer for common puddings extremely
well, and are of no value; whereas Seville are
usually dear, and sometimes cannot be had.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>To preserve Morella Cherries.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Gather them when full ripe, and perfectly dry,
take off the stalks, and prick them with a new needle
to prevent bursting. Weigh to every pound,
one and a half of sugar, beat part, and strew over
them; let them lie all night; dissolve the rest in
half a pint of currantjuice, set it over the fire, and
put in the cherries, and sugar that hangs about
them, give them a scald, then put them in a China
bowl; next day give them another scald, then take
them carefully out, boil the syrup till it is thick,
and pour it on them; look at it in a day or two, and
if too thin, boil it more, but gently.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>To keep Lemonjuice.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Buy the fruit when cheap, keep it in a cool place
until the colour becomes very yellow: cut the peel
off some, and roll them under your hand to make
them part with the juice more readily; others you
may leave unpared for grating, when the pulp
shall be taken out and dried. Squeeze the juice
into a China bason, then strain it through some
linen which will not permit the least pulp to pass.
Have ready some half and quarter ounce phials
perfectly dry: fill them with the juice so near to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_210'>210</span>the top as only to admit half a teaspoonful of sweet oil
into each; or a little more, if for larger bottles.
Cork the bottles, and set them upright in a cool
place.</p>

<p class='c010'>When you want lemonjuice, open such a sized
bottle as you shall use in two or three days, wind
some clean cotton round a skewer, and dipping it
in, the oil will be attracted; and when all shall
be removed, the juice will be as fine as when first
bottled.</p>

<p class='c010'>The peels hang up till dry, then keep them from
the dust.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c006'><i>Ice Waters.</i></h2>
</div>
<p class='c015'>Rub some fine sugar on lemon, or orange, to
give the colour and flavour; then squeeze the juice
of either on its respective peel: add water and
sugar, to make a fine sherbet, and strain it before
it be put into the icepot. If orange, the greater
proportion should be of the China juice, and only a
little of Seville, and a small bit of the peel grated
by the sugar.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Currant, or Raspberry water Ice.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>The juice of these, or any other sort of fruit,

<h3 class='c013'><i>Ice Creams.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Mix the juice of the fruits with as much sugar
as will be wanted, before you add cream, which
should be of a middling richness. Under the article
of <span class='fss'>FRUITS</span> is given a mode of preparing juice
for ice.</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_211'>211</span>
  <h3 class='c013'><i>Brown Bread Ice.</i></h3>
</div>

<p class='c014'>Grate as fine as possible stale brown bread, soak
a small proportion in cream two or three hours,
sweeten and ice it.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>To make the Ice.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Get a few pounds of ice, break it almost to powder,
throw a large handful and a half of salt among
it. You must prepare it in a part of the house
where as little of the warm air comes as you can
possibly contrive. The ice and salt being in a
bucket, put your cream into an ice pot, and cover
it; immerse it in the ice, and draw that round the
pot, so as to touch every possible part. In a few
minutes put a spatula or spoon in, and stir it well,
removing the parts that ice round the edges to the
centre. If the icecream or water be in a form,
shut the bottom close, and move the whole in the
ice, as you cannot use a spoon to that without danger
of waste.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Note.</i> When any fluid tends towards cold, the
moving it quickly accelerates the cold; and likewise,
when any fluid is tending to heat, stirring it
will facilitate its boiling.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Icing for Tarts.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Beat the yelk of an egg and some melted butter
well together, wash the tarts with a feather, and
sift sugar over as you put them in the oven. Or

<p class='c014'>For a large one, beat and sift eight ounces of fine
sugar, put into a mortar with four spoonfuls of rose
water, and the whites of two eggs beaten and
strained, whisk it well, and when the cake is almost
cold, dip a feather in the icing, and cover the cake
well; set it in the oven to harden, but do not let it
stay to discolour. Put the cake in a dry place.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c006'>CAKES.</h2>
</div>

<h3 class='c011'><i>Observations on making and baking Cakes.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Currants should be very nicely washed, dried in
a cloth, and then set before the fire. If damp they
will make cakes or puddings heavy. Before they are
added, a dust of dry flour should be thrown among
them, and a shake given to them, which causes the
thing that they are put to, to be lighter.</p>

<p class='c010'>Eggs should be very long beaten, whites and
yelks apart, and always strained.</p>

<p class='c010'>Sugar should be rubbed to a powder on a clean
board, and sifted through a very fine hair or lawn
sieve.</p>

<p class='c010'>Lemonpeel should be pared very thin, and with
a little sugar beaten in a marble mortar to a paste,
and then mixed with a little wine, or cream, so as
to divide easily among the other ingredients.</p>

<p class='c010'>After all the articles are put into the pan, they
should be thoroughly and long beaten, as the lightness
of the cake depends much on their being well
incorporated.</p>

<p class='c010'>Whether black or white plumcakes, they require
less butter and eggs for having yeast, and eat equally
<span class='pageno' id='Page_213'>213</span>light and rich. If the leaven be only of flour,
milk and water, and yeast, it becomes more tough,
and is less easily divided, and if the butter be first
put with those ingredients, and the dough afterwards
set to rise by the fire.</p>

<p class='c010'>The heat of the oven is of great importance for
cakes, especially those that are large. If not pretty
quick, the batter will not rise. Should you fear its
catching by being two quick, put some paper over
the cake to prevent its being burnt. If not long
enough lighted to have a body of heat, or it is become
slack, the cake will be heavy. To know
when it is soaked, take a broad bladed knife that is
very bright, and plunge into the very centre, draw
it instantly out, and if the least stickiness adheres,
put the cake immediately in, and shut up the oven.</p>

<p class='c010'>If the heat was sufficient to raise, but not to soak,
I have with great success had fresh fuel quickly
put in, and kept the cakes hot till the oven was fit
to finish the soaking, and they turned out extremely
well. But those who are employed, ought to be
particularly careful that no mistakes occur from
negligence when large cakes are to be baked.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Plumcake.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Mix thoroughly a quarter of a peck of fine flour,
well dried with a pound of dry and sifted loaf sugar,
three pounds of currants washed, and very dry,
half a pound of raisins stoned and chopped, a quarter
of an ounce of mace and cloves, twenty Jamaica
peppers, a grated nutmeg, the peel of a lemon cut
<span class='pageno' id='Page_214'>214</span>as fine as possible, and half a pound of almonds
blanched, and beaten with orange flour water.
Melt two pounds of butter in a pint and a quarter
of cream, but not hot, put to it a pint of sweet wine,
a glass of brandy, the whites and yelks of twelve
eggs beaten apart, and half a pint of good yeast.
Strain this liquid by degrees into the dry ingredients,
beating them together a full hour, then butter
the hoop, or pan, and bake it. As you put the
batter into the hoop, or pan, throw in plenty of
citron, lemon, and orange candy.</p>

<p class='c010'>If you ice the cake, take half a pound of double
refined sugar sifted, and put a little with the white
of an egg, beat it well, and by degrees pour in the
remainder. It must be whisked near an hour,
with the addition of a little orange flour water, but
mind not to put much. When the cake is done,
pour the icing over, and return it to the oven for
fifteen minutes; but if the oven be warm, keep it
near the mouth, and the door open; lest the colour
be spoiled.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Another Plumcake.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Flour dried, and currants washed and picked,
four pounds, sugar pounded and sifted one pound
and a half, six orange, lemon, and citron peels, cut
in slices; mix these.</p>

<p class='c010'>Beat ten eggs, yelks and whites separately; then
melt a pound and a half of butter in a pint of
cream; when lukewarm put it to half a pint of ale
yeast, near half a pint of sweet wine, and the eggs;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_215'>215</span>then strain the liquid to the dry ingredients, beat
them well, and add of cloves, mace, cinnamon and
nutmeg, half an ounce each. Butter the pan, and
put it into a quick oven. Three hours will bake it.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>A very fine Cake.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Wash two pounds and a half of fresh butter in
water first, and then in rosewater; beat the butter
to a cream: beat twenty eggs, yelk and whites
separately, half an hour each. Have ready two
pounds and a half of the finest flour, well dried,
and kept hot, likewise a pound and a half of sugar
pounded and sifted, one ounce of spice in finest powder,
three pounds of currants nicely cleaned and dry,
half a pound of almonds blanched, and three quarters
of a pound of sweetmeats cut not too thin. Let
all be kept by the fire, mix all the dry ingredients;
pour the eggs strained to the butter; mix half a
pint of sweet wine with a large glass of brandy,
pour it to the butter and eggs, mix well, then have
all the dry things put in by degrees; beat them
very thoroughly; you can hardly do it too much.
Having half a pound of stoned jar raisins chopped
as fine as possible, mix them carefully, so that
there shall be no lumps. Beat the ingredients together
a full hour at least. Have a hoop well buttered,
or if you have none, a tin, or copper cakepan;
take a white paper, doubled and buttered, and put
in the pan round the edge, if the cake batter fill it
more than three parts, for space should be allowed
for rising. Bake in a quick oven. It will require
three hours.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_216'>216</span>
  <h3 class='c013'><i>An excellent and less expensive Cake.</i></h3>
</div>

<p class='c014'>Rub two pounds of dry fine flour, with one of
butter, washed in plain and rosewater, mix it with
three spoonfuls of yeast in a little warm milk and
water. Set it to rise an hour and a half before the
fire, then beat into it two pounds of currants, one
pound of sugar sifted, four ounces of almonds, six
ounces of stoned raisins, chopped fine, half a nutmeg,
cinnamon, allspice, and a few cloves, the peel
of a lemon chopped as fine as possible, a glass of
wine, ditto of brandy, twelve yelks and whites
of eggs beat separately, and long; orange, citron,
and lemon. Beat exceedingly well, and butter the
pan. A quick oven.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>A very good Common Cake.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Rub eight ounces of butter into two pounds of
dried flour, mix it with three spoonfuls of yeast
that is not bitter, to a paste. Let it rise an hour
and a half; then mix in the yelks and whites of
six eggs beaten apart; one pound of sugar, some
milk to make it a proper thickness, (about a pint
will be sufficient,) a glass of sweet wine, the rind
of a lemon, and a teaspoonful of ginger. Add either
a pound and a half of currants, or some carraways,
and beat well.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>A cheap Seed Cake.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Mix a quarter of a peck of flour with half a
pound of sugar, a quarter of an ounce of allspice,
and a little ginger; melt three quarters of a pound
of butter with half a pint of milk; when just warm,
put to it a quarter of a pint of yeast, and work up
<span class='pageno' id='Page_217'>217</span>to a good dough. Let it stand before the fire a
few minutes before it goes to the oven; add seeds,
or currants, and bake an hour and a half.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Another.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Mix a pound and a half of flour, and a pound of
common lump sugar, eight eggs beaten separately,
an ounce of seeds, two spoonfuls of yeast, and the
same of milk and water.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Note.</i> Milk alone causes cake and bread soon to
dry.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Common Bread Cake.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Take the quantity of a quartern loaf from the
dough when making white bread, and knead well
into it two ounces of butter, two of Lisbon sugar,
and eight of currants. Warm the butter in a teacupful
of good milk.</p>

<p class='c010'>By the addition of an ounce of butter, or sugar,
or an egg or two, you may make the cake better.
A teacupful of raw cream improves it much. It is
best to bake it in a pan, rather than as a loaf, the
outside being less hard.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>A good Pound Cake.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Beat a pound of butter to a cream, and mix with
it the whites and yelks of eight eggs beaten apart.
Have ready warm by the fire, a pound of flour, and
the same of sifted sugar, mix them and a few
cloves, a little nutmeg and cinnamon in fine powder

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c006'><i>To make Yeast.</i></h2>
</div>
<p class='c015'>Thicken two quarts of water, with fine flour about
three spoonfuls; boil half an hour, sweeten with
near half a pound of brown sugar; when near cold,
put into it four spoonfuls of fresh yeast in a jug,
shake it well together, and let stand one day to
ferment near the fire, without being covered.
There will be a thin liquor on the top, which must
be poured off, shake the remainder, and cork it up
for use. Take always four spoonfuls of the old to
ferment the next quantity, keeping it always in
succession.</p>

<p class='c010'>An half peck loaf will require about a gill.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Another way.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Boil one pound of potatoes to a mash, when half
cold add a cupful of yeast, and mix it well. It
<span class='pageno' id='Page_230'>230</span>will be ready for use in two or three hours, and
keeps well.</p>

<p class='c010'>Use a double quantity of this to what you do of
beer yeast.</p>

<p class='c010'>To take off the bitter of yeast, put bran into a
sieve, and pour it through.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>To preserve Yeast.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>When you have plenty of yeast begin to save it
in the following manner; whisk it until it becomes
thin, then get a large wooden dish, wash it very
nicely, and when quite dry, lay a layer of yeast
over the inside with a soft brush; let it dry, then
put another layer in the same manner, and so do
until you have a sufficient quantity, observing that
each coat dry thoroughly before another be added.
It may be put on two or three inches thick, and
will keep several months; when to be used cut a
piece out; stir it in warm water.</p>

<p class='c010'>If to be used for brewing, keep it by dipping
large handfuls of birch tied together; and when
dry, repeat the dipping once. You may thus do
as many as you please; but take care that no
dust comes to them, or the vessel in which it has
been prepared as before. When the wort be set
to work, throw into it one of these bunches, and it
will do as well as with fresh yeast; but if mixed
with a small quantity first, and then added to the
whole, it will work sooner.</p>

<p class='c010'>The servants of each country are generally acquainted
with the best mode of managing the butter

hints may not be unacceptable to give information
to the Mistress.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c006'>DAIRY.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c015'>The greatest possible attention must be paid to
cleanliness. All the utensils must be daily scalded
<span class='pageno' id='Page_232'>232</span>and brushed, washed in plenty of cold water, dried
with clean cloths, and turned up in the air.</p>

<p class='c010'>The dairy should be kept perfectly clean and
cool.</p>

<p class='c010'>In milking, if the cows be not left perfectly
dry, the quantity will be decreased. The quantity
depends on the goodness of different cows, on the
pasture, and on the length of time from calving.
A middling cow gives a pound of butter a day for
five or six weeks, and sometimes longer. When
the milk decreases, a change even to a worse pasture
will effect an alteration; and where water is
within reach of the animals, it is of great consequence
to the milk.</p>

<p class='c010'>The chief of the cows should come in the end of
March, or the beginning of April, and one the end
of September; then the family will be supplied
with milk in the winter.</p>

<p class='c010'>When a calf is to be reared, it should be taken
from the cow in a week at furthest, or it will cause
great trouble in rearing, because it will be difficult
to make it take milk in a pan. The calf should be
taken from the cow in the morning, and kept without
food till next morning, when being hungry it
will take it without much trouble. Skimmed milk
made as warm as new, is to be given twice a day
in such quantities as it shall require and if milk
run short, a fine smooth gruel mixed with it will
do very well. This is to be continued till the calf
be taken out to grass, which at first will be only by
day, then milk must be given when housed in the
evening.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_233'>233</span>
  <h3 class='c013'><i>To scald Cream.</i></h3>
</div>

<p class='c014'>In winter the milk stands twenty four hours before
scalded; in the summer twelve. The milkpan
is to be put on a hot hearth, if you have one,
or if not, into a brass kettle of water, of a size to
receive the pan. It must remain on the fire till
quite hot, but on no account boil, or there will be
a skin, instead of cream, upon the milk. You will
know when done enough by the undulations on the
surface, and looking quite thick. The time required
to scald cream depends on the size of the
pan and the heat of the fire; the slower the better.
Remove the pan into the dairy when done, and
skim it next day.</p>

<p class='c010'>Of cream thus prepared, the butter is usually
made in Devonshire, &#38;c.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Buttermilk.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>If made of sweet cream, is a delicious and most
wholesome food. Those who can relish sour buttermilk,
find it still more light; and it is reckoned
more beneficial in some cases.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>To cure Mawskins for Rennet.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Cut the calf’s stomach open, rub it well with
salt, let it hang to drain two days, then salt it well,
and let it lie in that pickle a month or more; then
take it out, drain, and flour it, stretch it out with a
stick, and let it hang up to dry.</p>

<p class='c010'>A piece of this is to be soaked, and kept ready to
turn the milk in cheesemaking time.</p>

<p class='c010'>Some lands make cheese of a better quality than
the butter produced on them is.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_234'>234</span>When the soil is poor, the cheese will want fat;
to remedy which, after pressing the whey from
the curd, crumble it quite small, and work into it
a pound of fine fresh butter; then press, &#38;c. as
usual.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Cream Cheese.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Put five quarts of strippings, that is, the last of
the milk, into a pan, with two spoonfuls of rennet.
When the curd is come, strike it down two or three
times with the skimming dish just to break it. Let
it stand two hours, then spread a cheesecloth on a
sieve, put the curd on it, and let the whey drain;
break the curd a little with your hand, and put it
into a vat with a two pound weight upon it. Let it
stand twelve hours, take it out, and bind a fillet
round. Turn every day till dry, from one board to
another; cover them with nettles, or clean dockleaves,
and put between two pewter plates to ripen.
If the weather be warm, it will be ready in three
weeks.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Another.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Have ready a kettle of boiling water, put five
quarts of new milk into a pan, and <i>five pints</i> of cold
water, and <i>five</i> of hot; when of a proper heat, put
in as much rennet as will bring it in twenty minutes,
likewise a bit of sugar. When come, strike
the skimmer three or four times down, and leave
it on the curd. In an hour or two lade it into the
vat without touching it; put a two pound weight
on it when the whey has run from it, and the vat
is full.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_235'>235</span>
  <h3 class='c013'><i>Another sort.</i></h3>
</div>

<p class='c014'>Put as much salt to three pints of raw cream
as shall season it; stir it well, and pour it into a
sieve in which you have folded a cheesecloth three
or four times, and laid at the bottom. When it
hardens, cover it with nettles on a pewter plate.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Rush Cream Cheese.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>To a quart of fresh cream, put a pint of new
milk warm enough to make the cream a proper
warmth, a bit of sugar and a little rennet.</p>

<p class='c010'>Set near the fire till the curd comes, fill a vat
made in the form of a brick, of wheat straw or rushes
sewed together. Have ready a square of straw, or
rushes sewed flat to rest the vat on, and another to
cover it; the vat being open at top and bottom.
Next day take it out, and change it as above to
ripen. A half pound weight will be sufficient to
put on it.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Another way.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Take a pint of very thick sour cream from the
top of the pan for gathering for butter, lay a napkin
on two plates, and pour half into each, let them
stand twelve hours, then put them on a fresh wet
napkin in one plate, and cover with the same; this
do every twelve hours until you find the cheese
begins to look dry, then ripen it with nut leaves;
it will be ready in ten days.</p>

<p class='c010'>Fresh nettles, or two pewter plates, will ripen
cream cheese very well.</p>

  <h2 class='c006'><i>To brew very fine Welsh Ale.</i></h2>
</div>
<p class='c015'>Pour forty two gallons of water hot, but not quite
boiling, on four bushels of malt, cover, and let it
stand three hours. In the mean time infuse a
pound and a half of hops in a little hot water, or
two pounds if the ale is to be kept five or six
months, and put water and hops into the tub, and
run the wort upon them, and boil them together
three hours. Strain off the hops, and keep for the
small beer. Let the wort stand in a high tub till
cool enough to receive the yeast, of which put two
quarts of ale, or if you cannot get it, of small beer
yeast. Mix it thoroughly and often. When the
wort has done working, the second or third day, the
yeast will sink rather than rise in the middle, remove
it then, and turn the ale as it works out, pour
a quart in at a time, and gently, to prevent the
fermentation from continuing too long, which weakens
the liquor. Put a bit of paper over the bunghole
two or three days before stopping up.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Strong Beer, or Ale.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Twelve bushels of malt to the hogshead for beer,
eight for ale; for either pour the whole quantity
of water hot, but not boiling, on at once, and let it
infuse three hours close covered; mash it in the
first half hour, and let it stand the remainder of the
time. Run it on the hops previously infused in
water; for strong beer three quarters of a pound to
a bushel, if for ale, half a pound. Boil them with
the wort two hours from the time it begins to boil.
Cool a pailful to add three quarts of yeast to, which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_237'>237</span>will prepare it for putting to the rest when ready
next day; but if possible, put together the same
night. Turn as usual. Cover the bunghole with
paper when the beer has done working; and when
it is to be stopped have ready a pound and a half
of hops, dried before the fire, put them into the
bunghole, and fasten it up.</p>

<p class='c010'>Let it stand twelve months in casks, and twelve
in bottles before it be drank. It will keep, and be
very fine, eight or ten years. It should be brewed
the beginning of March.</p>

<p class='c010'>Great care must be taken that bottles are perfectly
prepared, and that the corks are of the best
sort.</p>

<p class='c010'>The ale will be ready in three or four months;
and if the vent peg be never removed, it will have
spirit and strength to the very last. Allow two
gallons of water at first for waste.</p>

<p class='c010'>After the beer or ale is run from the grains, pour
a hogshead and a half for the twelve bushels, and a
hogshead of water if eight were brewed; mash,
and let stand, and then boil, &#38;c. Use some of the
hops for this table beer that were boiled for the
strong beer.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Excellent Table Beer.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>On three bushels of malt pour of hot water the
third of the quantity you are to use, which is to be
thirty nine gallons. Cover it warm half an hour,
then mash, and let it stand two hours and a half
more, then set it to drain. When dry, add half the
remaining water, mash, and let it stand half an
<span class='pageno' id='Page_238'>238</span>hour, run that into another tub, and pour the rest
of the water on the malt, stir it well, and cover it,
letting it infuse a full hour. Run that off, and mix
all together. A pound and a quarter of hops should
be infused in water, as in the former receipt, and
be put into the tub for the first running.</p>

<p class='c010'>Boil the hops with the wort an hour from the
time it first boils. Strain off, and cool. If the
whole be not cool enough that day to add to the
yeast, a pail or two of wort may be prepared, and
a quart of yeast put to it over night. Before tunning,
all the wort should be added together, and
thoroughly mixed with the lade pail. When the
wort ceases to work, put a bit of paper on the bunghole
for three days, when it may be safely fastened
close. In three or four weeks the beer will be fit
for drinking.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Note.</i> Servants should be directed to put a cork
into every barrel as soon as the cock is taken out,
the air causing casks to become musty.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>To refine Beer, Ale, Wine, or Cider.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Put two ounces of isinglass shavings to soak in

with a whisk every day till dissolved. Draw off a
third part of the cask, and mix the above with it;
likewise a quarter of an ounce of pearlashes, one
ounce of salt of tartar calcined, and one ounce of
burnt alum powdered. Stir it well, then return the
liquor into the cask, and stir it with a clean stick.
Stop it up, and in a few days it will be fine.</p>

<p class='c014'>Boil a quart of new milk with a stick of cinnamon,
sweeten to your taste, and let grow cold;
then pour it by degrees to three ounces of almonds,
and twenty bitter, that have been blanched and
beaten to a paste, with a little water to prevent
oiling; boil all together, and stir till cold, then add
half a glass of brandy.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Another way.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Blanch and pound three quarters of a pound of
almonds, and thirty bitter, with a spoonful of water.
Stir in by degrees two pints of water, and
three of milk, and strain the whole through a cloth.
Dissolve half a pound of fine sugar in a pint of water,
boil and skim it well; mix it with the other, as
likewise two spoonfuls of orange flower water, and
a teacupful of the best brandy.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Lemonade. To be made a day before wanted.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Pare two dozen of tolerably sized lemons as thin
as possible, put eighteen of the rinds into three
quarts of hot, not boiling water, and cover it over
for three or four hours. Rub some fine sugar on
the lemons to attract the essence, and put it into a
China bowl, into which squeeze the juice of the
lemons: to it add one pound and a half of fine
sugar, then put the water to the above, and three
quarts of milk made boiling hot; mix, and pour
through a jellybag till perfectly clear.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_240'>240</span>
  <h3 class='c013'><i>Another way.</i></h3>
</div>

<p class='c014'>Pare a number of lemons according to the quantity
you are likely to want; on the peels pour hot
water, but more juice will be necessary than you
need use the peels of. While infusing, boil sugar
and water to a good syrup with the white of an egg
whipt up. When it boils, pour a little cold water
into it; set it on again, and when it boils up take
the pan off, and set it to settle. If there is any
skum, take it off, and pour it clear from the sediment
to the water the peels were infused in, and
the lemonjuice; stir and taste it, and add as much
more water as shall be necessary to make a very
rich lemonade. Wet a jellybag, and squeeze it
dry, then strain the liquor, which is uncommonly
fine.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Raspberry vinegar.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Put a pound of fine fruit into a China bowl, and
pour upon it a quart of the best white wine vinegar;
next day strain the liquor on a pound of fresh raspberries;
and the following day do the same, but do
not squeeze the fruit, only drain the liquor as dry as
you can from it. The last time pass it through a
canvass previously wet with vinegar to prevent
waste. Put it into a stonejar, with a pound of sugar
to every pint of juice, broken into large lumps;
stir it when melted, then put the jar into a saucepan
of water, or on a hot hearth, let it simmer, and
skim it. When cold, bottle it.</p>

<p class='c010'>This is one of the most useful preparations that
can be kept in a house, not only as affording the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_241'>241</span>most refreshing beverage, but being of singular efficacy
in complaints of the chest. A large spoonful
or two in a tumbler of water.</p>

<p class='c010'>N. B. Use no glazed or metal vessel for it.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Note.</i> The fruit, with equal quantity of sugar,
makes excellent raspberry cakes without boiling.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Raspberry wine.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>To every quart of well picked raspberries put a
quart of water; bruise, and let them stand two
days; strain off the liquor, and to every gallon put
three pounds of lump sugar; when dissolved put
the liquor in a barrel, and when fine, which will be
in about two months, bottle it, and to each bottle
put a spoonful of brandy, or a glass of wine.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Raspberry, or Currant wine.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>To every three pints of fruit, carefully cleared
from mouldy or bad, put one quart of water; bruise
the former. In twenty four hours strain the liquor,
and put to every quart a pound of sugar, a
good middling quality of Lisbon. If for white currants,
use lump sugar. It is best to put the fruit,
&#38;c. in a large pan, and when in three or four days
the skum rises, take that off before the liquor be
put into the barrel.</p>

<p class='c010'>Those who make from their own gardens may
not have a sufficiency to fill the barrel at once.
The wine will not be hurt if made in the pan, in
the above proportions, and added as the fruit ripens,
and can be gathered in dry weather. Keep an account
of what is put in each time.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_242'>242</span>
  <h3 class='c013'><i>Imperial.</i></h3>
</div>

<p class='c014'>Put two ounces of cream of tartar, and the juice
and paring of two lemons into a stonejar; pour on
them seven quarts of boiling water, stir and cover
close. When cold, sweeten with loaf sugar, and
straining it, bottle and cork it tight.</p>

<p class='c010'>This is a very pleasant liquor, and very wholesome;
but from the latter consideration was at one
time drank in such quantities, as to become injurious.
Add, in bottling, half a pint of rum to the
whole quantity.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Excellent Gingerwine.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Put into a very nice boiler ten gallons of water,
twelve pounds and a half of lump sugar, with the
whites of six or eight eggs well beaten and strained;
mix all well while cold; when the liquor boils,
skim it well; put in half a pound of common white
ginger bruised, boil it twenty minutes. Have ready
the very thin rinds of ten lemons, and pour the liquor
on them; when <i>cool</i>, turn it with two spoonfuls
of yeast; put a quart of the liquor to two
ounces of isinglass shavings, while warm, <i>whisk</i> it
well three or four times, and pour all together into
the barrel. Next day stop it up; in three weeks
bottle, and in three months it will be a delicious
and refreshing liquor; and though very cool, perfectly
safe.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Another for Gingerwine.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Boil nine quarts of water with six pounds of
lump sugar, the rinds of two or three lemons very
thinly pared, with two ounces of bruised white ginger
<span class='pageno' id='Page_243'>243</span>half an hour; skim. Put three quarters of a
pound of raisins into the cask; when the liquor is
lukewarm, tun it with the juice of two lemons
strained, and a spoonful and a half of yeast. Stir it
daily, then put in half a pint of brandy, and half an
ounce of isinglass shavings; stop it up, and bottle
it six or seven weeks. Do not put the lemonpeel
in the barrel.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Alderwine.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>To every quart of berries put two quarts of water,
<i>boil</i> half an hour, run the liquor, and break the fruit
through a hair sieve; then to every quart of juice,
put three quarters of a pound of Lisbon sugar, not
the very coarsest, but coarse. Boil the whole a
quarter of an hour with some Jamaica peppers,
ginger, and a few cloves. Pour it into a tub, and
when of a proper warmth into the barrel, with toast
and yeast to work, which there is more difficulty to
make it do than most other liquors. When it ceases
to hiss, put a quart of brandy to eight gallons, and
stop up. Bottle in the spring or at Christmas.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>White Alderwine; very much like Frontiniac.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Boil eighteen pounds of white powder sugar,
with six gallons of water, and two whites of eggs
well beaten; then skim it, and put in a quarter of a
peck of alder flowers from the tree that bears <i>white</i>
berries; do not keep them on the fire. When
near cold, stir it, and put in six spoonfuls of lemonjuice,
four or five of yeast, and beat well into the
liquor; stir it every day; put six pounds of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_244'>244</span>best raisins, stoned, into the cask, and tun the wine.
Stop it close, and bottle in six months.</p>

<p class='c010'>When well kept, this wine will pass for Frontiniac.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Clary Wine.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Boil fifteen gallons of water, with forty five pounds
of sugar, skim it, when cool put a little to a quarter
of a pint of yeast, and so by degrees add a little
more. In an hour pour the small quantity to the
large, pour the liquor on clary flowers, picked in the
dry; the quantity for the above is twelve quarts.
Those who gather from their own garden may not
have sufficient to put in at once, and may add as
they can get them, keeping account of each quart.
When it ceases to hiss, and the flowers are all in,
stop it up for four months. Rack it off, empty
the barrel of the dregs, and adding a gallon of the
best brandy, stop it up, and let it stand six or eight
weeks then bottle it.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>A rich and pleasant Wine.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Take new cyder from the press, mix it with as
much honey as will support an egg, boil gently fifteen
minutes, but not in an iron, brass, or copper
pot. Skim it well; when cool, let it be tunned,
but do not quite fill. In March following bottle it,
and it will be fit to drink in six weeks; will be less
sweet if kept longer in the cask. You will have a
rich and strong wine, and it will keep well. This
will serve for any culinary purposes which sack,
or sweet wine, are directed for.</p>

<p class='c010'>Duhamel says, honey is a fine ingredient to assist,
and render palatable, new crabbed austere cider.</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_245'>245</span>
  <h3 class='c013'><i>Raisinwine, with Cider.</i></h3>
</div>

<p class='c014'>Put two hundred weight of Malaga raisins into
a cask, and pour upon them a hogshead of good
sound cider that is not rough. Stir it well two or
three days; stop it, and let it stand six months;
then rack into a cask that it will fill, and put in a
gallon of the best brandy.</p>

<p class='c010'>If raisinwine be much used, it would answer
well to keep a cask always for it, and bottle off one
year’s wine just in time to make the next, which,
allowing the six months of infusion, would make
the wine to be eighteen months old. In cider
countries this way is very economical; and even if
not thought strong enough, the addition of another
quarter of a hundred of raisins would be sufficient,
and the wine would still be very cheap.</p>

<p class='c010'>When the raisins are pressed through a horsehair
bag, they will either produce a very good spirit
by distillation, and must be sent to a chymist who
will do it (but if for that purpose, they must be very
little pressed); or they will make excellent vinegar,
on which article see page <a href='#Page_116'>116</a>.</p>

to hiss, stop it close. In six months rack it off into
another cask, or into a tub, and after clearing out
the sediment, return it into the same, but do not

very little meat to it, an old fowl, and four shankbones
of mutton extremely well soaked and brushed,
three blades of mace, ten peppercorns, an onion,
and a large bit of bread, and three quarts of water,
into a stewpot that covers close, and simmer in the
slowest manner after it has boiled up, and been
skimmed; or, bake it; strain and take off the fat.
Salt as wanted.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>A clear Broth that will keep long.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Put the mouse round of beef, a knucklebone of
veal, and a few shanks of mutton into a deep pan,
and cover close with a dish or coarse crust; bake
till the beef is done enough for eating, with only as
much water as will cover. When cold, cover it
close in a cool place. When to be used, give what
flavour may be approved.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Dr. Ratcluff’s restorative Porkjelly.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Take a leg of well fed pork, just as cut up, beat
it, and break the bone. Set it over a gentle fire,
with three gallons of water, and simmer to one.
Let half an ounce of mace, and the same of nutmegs,
stew in it. Strain through a line sieve.
When cold, take off the fat. Give a chocolate cup
<span class='pageno' id='Page_250'>250</span>the first and last thing, and at noon, putting salt to
taste.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Beef tea.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Cut a pound of fleshy beef in thin slices, simmer
with a quart of water twenty minutes, after it
has once boiled, and been skimmed. Season, if
approved; but it has generally only salt.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Broth of Beef, Mutton, and Veal.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Put two pounds of lean beef, two pounds of
scrag of mutton, sweet herbs, and ten peppercorns,
into a nice tin saucepan, with five quarts of water;
simmer to three quarts; and clear from the fat
when cold.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Note.</i> That soup and broth made of different
meats are more supporting, as well as better flavoured.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c006'>TWO WAYS OF PREPARING A CHICKEN.</h2>
</div>
<h3 class='c011'><i>Chicken panada.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Boil it till about three parts ready in a quart of
water, take off the skin, cut the white meat off
when cold, and put into a marble mortar; pound it
to a paste with a little of the water it was boiled in,
season with a little salt, a grate of nutmeg, and the
least bit of lemonpeel. Boil gently for a few minutes
to the consistency you like; it should be such
as you can drink, though tolerably thick.</p>

<p class='c010'>This conveys great nourishment in small compass.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Chicken broth.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Put the body and legs of the fowl that the panada
was made of, taking off the skin and rump, into the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_251'>251</span>water it was boiled in, with one blade of mace, one
slice of onion, and ten white peppercorns. Simmer
till the broth be of a pleasant flavour. If not
water enough, add a little. Beat a quarter of an
ounce of sweet almonds, with a teaspoonful of water,
fine, boil it in the broth, strain, and when cold,
remove the fat.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Shank jelly.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Soak twelve shanks of mutton four hours, then
brush and scour them very clean. Lay them in a
saucepan with three blades of mace, an onion,
twenty Jamaica, and thirty or forty black peppers,
a bunch of sweet herbs, and a crust of bread made
very brown by toasting. Pour three quarts of water
to them, and set them on a hot hearth close
covered; let them simmer as gently as possible
for five hours, then strain it off, and put it in a cold
place.</p>

<p class='c010'>This may have the addition of a pound of beef,
if approved, for flavour.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Eel broth.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Clean half a pound of small eels, and set them on
with three pints of water, some parsley, one slice of
onion, a few peppercorns; let them simmer till the
eels are broken, and the broth good. Add salt.</p>

<p class='c010'>The above should make three half pints of broth.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Tench broth.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Make as above. They are both very nutritious,
and light of digestion.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_252'>252</span>
  <h3 class='c013'><i>A quick made Broth.</i></h3>
</div>

<p class='c014'>Take a bone or two of a neck or loin of mutton,
take off the fat and skin, set it on the fire in a small
tin saucepan that has a cover, with three quarters
of a pint of water, the meat being first beaten, and
cut in thin bits; put a bit of thyme and parsley,
and, if approved, a slice of onion. Let it boil very
quick, skim it nicely; take off the cover, if likely
to be too weak; else cover it. Half an hour is
sufficient for the whole process.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Calf’s feet Broth.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Boil two feet in three quarts of water to half;
strain and set it by. When to be used, take off the
fat, put a large teacupful of the jelly into a saucepan,
with half a glass of sweet wine, a little sugar
and nutmeg, and heat it up till it be ready to boil,
then take a little of it, and beat by degrees to the
yelk of an egg, and adding a bit of butter, the size
of a nutmeg, stir it altogether, but do not let it
boil. Grate a bit of fresh lemonpeel into it.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Another.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Boil two calf’s feet, two ounces of veal, and two
of beef, the bottom of a penny loaf, two or three
blades of mace, half a nutmeg sliced, and a little
salt, in three quarts of water, to three pints; strain,
and take off the fat.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Panada; made in five minutes.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Set a little water on the fire with a glass of white
wine, some sugar, and a scrape of nutmeg and lemonpeel;
meanwhile grate some crumbs of bread.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_253'>253</span>The moment the mixture boils up, keeping it still
on the fire, put the crumbs in, and let it boil as fast
as it can. When of a proper thickness just to
drink, take it off.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Another.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>As above, but instead of a glass of wine, put in a
spoonful, a teaspoonful of rum, and a bit of butter;
sugar as above.</p>

<p class='c010'>This is a most pleasant mess.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Another.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Put to the water a bit of lemonpeel, mix the
crumbs in, and when nearly boiled enough, put
some lemon or orange syrup.</p>

<p class='c010'>Observe to boil all the ingredients; for if any be
added after, the panada will break, and not jelly.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Barleywater.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Boil an ounce of pearlbarley a few minutes to
cleanse, then put on it a quart of water, simmer
an hour; when half done, put into it a bit of fresh
lemonpeel, and one bit of sugar. If likely to be
too thick, you may put another quarter of a pint
of water.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Common Barleywater.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Wash a handful of common barley, then simmer
it gently in three pints of water with a bit of
lemonpeel.</p>

<p class='c010'>This is less apt to nauseate than pearlbarley;
but the former is a very pleasant drink.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>A very agreeable Drink.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Into a tumbler of fresh cold water pour a table
spoonful of capillaire; and the same of good vinegar.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_254'>254</span>
  <h3 class='c013'><i>Lemon water; a delightful drink.</i></h3>
</div>

<p class='c014'>Put two slices of lemon thinly pared into a teapot,
and a little bit of the peel, and a bit of sugar,
or a large spoonful of capillaire; pour in a pint of
boiling water, and stop close.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Apple water.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Cut two large apples in slices, and pour a quart
of boiling water on them; or on roasted apples.</p>

<p class='c010'>Tamarinds, currants fresh or in jelly, or scalded
currants, or cranberries, make excellent drinks;
with a little sugar or not, as may be agreeable.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Raspberry Vinegarwater. See page <a href='#Page_240'>240</a>.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>This is one of the most delightful drinks that
can be made.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Toast and Water.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Toast slowly a thin piece of bread till extremely
brown and hard, but not the least black, then plunge
it into a jug of cold water, and cover it over an
hour before used.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Orangeade, or Lemonade.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Squeeze the juice; pour boiling water on a little
of the peel, and cover close. Boil water and sugar
to a thin syrup, and skim it. When all are cold,
mix the juice, the infusion, and the syrup, with as
much more water as will make a rich sherbet;
strain through a jellybag. Or, squeeze the juice,
and strain it, and add water and capillaire.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Orgeat.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Beat two ounces of almonds with a teaspoonful
of orange flower water, and a bitter almond or two;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_255'>255</span>then pour a quart of milk and water to the paste.
Sweeten with sugar, or capillaire.</p>

<p class='c010'>Another orgeat for company, page <a href='#Page_239'>239</a>.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Milkporridge.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Make a fine gruel of half grits, long boiled; strain
off; either add cold milk, or warm with milk as
may be approved. Serve with toast.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>French Milkporridge.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Stir some oatmeal and water together, let it stand
to be clear, and pour off the latter: pour fresh
upon it, stir it well, let it stand till next day; strain
through a fine sieve, and boil the water, adding
milk while doing. The proportion of water must
be small.</p>

<p class='c010'>This is much ordered, with toast, for the breakfast
of weak persons abroad.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Caudle.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Make a fine smooth gruel of half grits; strain
it when boiled well, stir it at times till cold. When
to be used, add sugar, wine, and lemonpeel, with
nutmeg. Some like a spoonful of brandy besides
the wine.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Another Caudle.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Boil up half a pint of fine gruel, with a bit of
butter the size of a large nutmeg, a large spoonful
of brandy, the same of white wine, one of capillaire,
a bit of lemonpeel and nutmeg.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Rice Caudle.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>When the water boils, pour it into some grated
rice mixed with a little cold water; when of a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_256'>256</span>proper consistence add sugar, lemonpeel and cinnamon,
and a glass of brandy to a quart. Boil all
smooth.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Cold Caudle.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Boil a quart of spring water; when cold, add the
yelk of an egg, the juice of a small lemon, six
spoonfuls of sweet wine, sugar to your taste; and
syrup of lemons one ounce.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>A refreshing drink in a Fever.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Put a little tea sage, two sprigs of balm, and a
<i>little</i> woodsorrel into a stone jug, having first washed
and dried them; peel thin a small lemon, and
clear from the white; slice it, and put a bit of the
peel in, then pour in three points of boiling water,
sweeten, and cover it close.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Another Drink.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Wash extremely well an ounce of pearlbarley;
shift it twice, then put to it three pints of water, an
ounce of sweet almonds beaten fine, and a bit of
lemonpeel. Boil till you have a smooth liquor, then
put in a little syrup of lemons and capillaire.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Another Drink.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Boil three pints of water with an ounce and a
half of tamarinds, three ounces of currants, and two
ounces of stoned raisins, till near a third be consumed.
Strain it.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>A most pleasant Drink.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Put a teacupful of cranberries into a cup of water,
and mash them. In the mean time boil two quarters
<span class='pageno' id='Page_257'>257</span>and a pint of water with one large spoonful of
oatmeal, and a very large bit of lemonpeel: then
add the cranberries, and as much fine Lisbon sugar
as shall leave a smart flavour of the fruit; and a
quarter of a pint of sherry or less, as may be proper;
boil all for half an hour, and strain off.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Whey.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>That of cheese is a very wholesome drink, especially
when the cows are in fresh herbage.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>White Wine whey.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Put half a pint of new milk on the fire; the
moment it boils up, pour in as much sound raisin
wine as will completely turn it, and it looks clear;
let it boil up, then set the saucepan aside till the
curd subsides, and do not stir it. Pour the whey
off, and add to it half a pint of boiling water, and a
bit of white sugar. Thus you will have a whey
perfectly cleared of milky particles, and as weak as
you choose to make it.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Vinegar and Lemon wheys.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Pour into boiling milk as above, and when clear,
dilute with boiling water, and put a bit or two of
sugar.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Eggwine.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Beat an egg, mix with it a spoonful of cold water;
set on the fire a glass of white wine, half a glass
of water and sugar, and nutmeg. When it boils,
pour a little of it to the egg by degrees, till the
whole be in, stirring it well; then return the whole
into the saucepan, put it on a gentle fire, stir it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_258'>258</span>one way for not more than a minute; for if it boil,
or the egg be stale, it will curdle. Serve with
toast.</p>

<p class='c010'>Eggwine may be made as above, without warming
the egg, and it is then lighter on the stomach,
though not so pleasant to the taste.</p>

<p class='c010'>An egg broken into a cup of tea, or beaten and
mixed with a bason of milk, makes a breakfast
more supporting than tea.</p>

<p class='c010'>An egg divided, and the yelk and white beaten
separately, then mixed with a glass of wine, will
afford two very wholesome draughts, and prove
lighter than when taken together.</p>

<p class='c010'>Eggs very little boiled or poached, taken in small
quantity, convey much nourishment.</p>

<p class='c004'><i>The following is a particularly soft and fine draught,
to be taken the first and last thing, by those who
are weak, and have a cough.</i></p>

<p class='c010'>Beat a fresh laid egg, and mix it with a quarter
of a pint of new milk warmed, a large spoonful of
capillaire, the same of rosewater, and a little nutmeg
scraped. Do not warm after the egg is put in.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Chocolate.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Those who use much of this article, will find
the following mode of preparing both useful and
economical.</p>

<p class='c010'>Cut a cake of chocolate in very small bits; put a
pint of water into the pot, and, when it boils, put in
the above; mill it off the fire until quite melted,
then on a gentle fire till it boil; pour it into a bason,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_259'>259</span>and it will keep in a cool place eight or ten days,
or more. When wanted put a spoonful or two into
milk, boil it with sugar, and mill it well.</p>

<p class='c010'>This, if not made thick, is a very good breakfast
or supper.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>To make Coffee.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Put two ounces of fresh ground coffee of the best
quality into a coffeepot, and pour eight coffee cups
of boiling water on it; let it boil six minutes, pour
out a cupful two or three times, and return it
again; then put two or three isinglass chips into
it, and pour one large spoonful of boiling water on
it; boil it five minutes more, and set the pot by the
fire to keep hot for ten minutes, and you will have
coffee, of a beautiful clearness.</p>

<p class='c010'>Fine cream should always be served with coffee,
and either pounded sugarcandy or fine Lisbon
sugar.</p>

<p class='c010'>If for foreigners, or those who like it extremely
strong, make only eight dishes from three ounces.
If not fresh roasted, lay it before a fire until perfectly
hot and dry; or you may put the smallest
bit of fresh butter into a preserving pan of a small
size, and, when hot throw the coffee in it, and toss
it about until it be freshened.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Coffee Milk.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Boil a dessert spoonful of ground coffee, in nearly
a pint of milk, a quarter of an hour; then put into
it a shaving or two of isinglass, and clear it. Let
it boil a few minutes, and set it on the side of the
fire to grow fine.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_260'>260</span>This is a very fine breakfast. It should be
sweetened with real Lisbon sugar of a good quality.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Ground Rice Milk.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Boil one spoonful of ground rice, rubbed down
smooth, with three half pints of milk, a bit of cinnamon,
lemonpeel, and nutmeg. Sweeten when
nearly done.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Tapioca jelly.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Choose the largest sort, pour cold water on to
wash it two or three times, then soak it in fresh
water five or six hours, and simmer it in the same
until it become quite clear; then put lemonjuice,
wine, and sugar. The peel should have been boiled
in it. It thickens very much.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Sago.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>To prevent the earthy taste, soak it in cold
water an hour; pour that off, and wash it well; then
add more, and simmer gently till the berries are
clear, with lemonpeel and spice, if approved. Add
wine and sugar, and boil all up together.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Sago Milk.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Cleanse as above, and boil it slowly and wholly
with new milk. It swells so much that a small
quantity will be sufficient for a quart, and when
done it will be diminished to about a pint. It requires
no sugar, or flavouring.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Arrowroot jelly.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Of this beware of having the wrong sort; for it
has been counterfeited with bad effect.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_261'>261</span>Mix a large spoonful of the powder with, a teacup
of cold water, by degrees, and quite smooth.
Put rather more than a pint of water over the fire,
with some white sugar, scraped nutmeg, and a
spoonful and a half of brandy, or two. The moment
it boils, pour the powder and water in, stirring it
well; and when it boils up it is done.</p>

<p class='c010'>This is a very useful thing in a house; and in
the above mode a sick person may be supplied with
a fine supporting meal in a few minutes.</p>

<p class='c010'>This and the following are particularly good in
bowel complaints.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>A Flour Caudle.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Into five large spoonfuls of the purest water, rub
smooth one dessertspoonful of fine flour. Set
over the fire five spoonfuls of new milk, and put
two bits of sugar into it; the moment it boils, pour
into it, the flour and water, and stir it over a slow
fire twenty minutes.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>A Rice Caudle.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Soak some Carolina rice in water an hour, strain
it, and put two spoonfuls of the rice into a pint and
a quarter of milk; simmer till it will pulp through
a sieve, then put the pulp and milk into the saucepan,
with a bruised clove and a bit of white sugar.
Simmer ten minutes; if too thick, add a spoonful
or two of milk, and serve with thin toast.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Gloucester jelly.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Take rice, sago, pearlbarley, hartshorn shavings
and eringoroot, each an ounce; simmer with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_262'>262</span>two pints of water to one, and strain it. When
cold it will be a jelly; of which give, dissolved in
wine, milk, or broth, in change with other nourishment.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Mulled wine.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Boil some spice in a little water till the flavour
is gained, then add an equal quantity of port, some
sugar and nutmeg; boil together, and serve with
toast.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Asses’ Milk</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Far surpasses any imitation of it that can be
made. It should be milked into a glass that is kept
warm by being in a bason of hot water.</p>

<p class='c010'>The fixed air that it contains gives some people
a pain in the stomach.</p>

<p class='c010'>At first a teaspoonful of rum may be taken with
it, but should only be put in the moment it is to be
swallowed.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Artificial Asses’ Milk.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Boil together a quart of water, a quart of new
milk, an ounce of white sugarcandy, half an ounce
of eringoroot, and half an ounce of conserve of
roses, till half be wasted.</p>

<p class='c010'>This is astringent; therefore proportion the
doses to the effect.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Another.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Mix two spoonfuls of boiling water, two of milk,
and an egg well beaten; sweeten with pounded
white sugarcandy.</p>

<p class='c010'>This may be taken twice or thrice a day.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_263'>263</span>
  <h3 class='c013'><i>Another.</i></h3>
</div>

<p class='c014'>Boil two ounces of hartshorn shavings, two ounces
of pearlbarley, two ounces of candied eringoroot,
and one dozen of snails that have been bruised, in
two quarts of water to one. Mix with an equal
quantity of new milk, when taken, twice a day.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Buttermilk, with Bread or without.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>It is most wholesome when sour, as being less
likely to be heavy, but most agreeable when made
of sweet cream.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Dr. Boerhaave’s sweet Buttermilk.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Take the milk from the cow into a small churn,
of about six shillings price; in about ten minutes
begin churning, and continue till the flakes of butter
swim about pretty thick, and the milk is discharged
of all the greasy particles, and appears thin
and blue. Strain it through a sieve, and drink it
as frequently as possible.</p>

<p class='c010'>It should form the whole of the patient’s drink,
and the food should be biscuit and rusks, in every
way and sort; ripe and dried fruits of various kinds,
when a decline is apprehended.</p>

<p class='c010'>Baked and dried fruits, raisins in particular, make
excellent suppers for invalids, with biscuit or
common cake.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>When the Stomach will not receive Meat.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>On an extreme hot plate put two or three sippets
of bread, and pour over them some gravy from
beef, mutton, or veal, if there is no butter in the
dish. Sprinkle a little salt over.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_264'>264</span>This is much lighter than meat, and conveys a
great deal of nourishment in a small form.</p>

<p class='c010'>Toast hard and dry a thin bit of bread, soak it
in water, or port wine and water, take it out and
sift a little sugar, and, if you like it, nutmeg.</p>

<p class='c010'>Or pour boiling water over a captain’s biscuit,
broken in pieces, and steam it down in a bason;
when soft, add a little strong souchong tea, cream,
and sugar, or wine, sugar, and nutmeg; or a teacupful
of weak rum, or brandy and water, with
sugar, just to give taste.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Saloop.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Boil a little water, with wine, lemonpeel, and
sugar, together; then mix with a small quantity of
the powder, previously rubbed smooth, with a little
cold water; stir it all together, and boil it a few
minutes.</p>

<hr class='c016'>

<p class='c010'>I promised a few hints, to enable every family to
assist the poor of their neighborhood at a very
trivial expense; and these may be varied or amended
at the discretion of the mistress.</p>

<p class='c010'>Where cows are kept, a jug of skimmed milk is
a valuable present.</p>

<p class='c010'>When the oven is hot, a large pudding may be
baked, and given to a sick or young family; and
thus made, the trouble is little: into a deep coarse
pan put half a pound of rice, four ounces of coarse
sugar or treacle, two quarts of milk, and two ounces
<span class='pageno' id='Page_265'>265</span>of dripping, set it cold into the oven. It will take
a good while, but be an excellent solid food.</p>

<p class='c010'>A very good meal may be bestowed in a thing
called Brewis, which is thus made: cut a very
thick upper crust of bread and put it into the pot
where salt beef is boiling and near ready; it will
attract some of the fat, and, when swelled out, will
be no unpalatable dish to those who rarely taste
meat.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>A baked Soup.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Put a pound of any kind of meat cut in slices;
two onions, two carrots, ditto; two ounces of rice,
a pint of split peas, or whole ones if previously
soaked, pepper and salt, into an earthen jug or pan,
and pour one gallon of water. Cover it very close,
and bake it with the bread.</p>

<p class='c010'>The cook should be charged to save the boiling of
every piece of meat, ham, tongue, &#38;c. however salt:
as it is easy to use only a part of that, and the rest
of fresh water, and by the addition of more vegetables,
the bones of the meat used in the family, the
pieces of meat that come from table on the plates,
and rice, Scotch barley or oatmeal, there will be
some gallons of nutritious soup two or three times
a week. The bits of meat should be only warmed
in the soup, and remain whole; the bones, &#38;c. boiled
till they yield their nourishment. If the things
are ready to put in the boiler as soon as the meat be
served, it will save lighting fire and second cooking.</p>

<p class='c010'>Turnips, carrots, leeks, potatoes, or any sort
of vegetable that is at hand, should be used.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_266'>266</span>Should the soup be poor of meat, the long boiling
of the bones and different vegetables, will afford
better nourishment than the laborious poor can
obtain; especially as they are rarely tolerable cooks,
and have not fuel to do justice to what they buy.
But in every family there is some superfluity;
and if it be prepared with cleanliness and care, the
benefit will be very great to the receiver, and the
satisfaction no less to the giver.</p>

<p class='c010'>I found, in the time of scarcity, ten or fifteen
gallons of soup, could be dealt out weekly, at an
expense not worth mentioning, though the vegetables
were bought. If in the villages about London,
abounding with opulent families, the quantity of
ten gallons were made in ten gentlemen’s houses,
there would be a hundred gallons of wholesome
agreeable food given weekly for the supply of forty
poor families, at the rate of two gallons and a half
each.</p>

<p class='c010'>What a relief to the labouring husband, instead
of bread and cheese, to have a warm comfortable
meal! To the sick, aged, and infant branches, how
important an advantage.</p>

<p class='c010'>It very rarely happens, that servants object to
seconding the kindness of their superiors to the
poor; but should the cook in any family think the
adoption of this plan too troublesome, a gratuity
at the end of the winter might repay her, if the love
of her fellow creatures failed of doing it, a hundred
fold. Did she readily enter into it, she would
never wash away as useless the pease or grits of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_267'>267</span>which soup or gruel had been made; broken
potatoes, the green heads of celery, the necks and
feet of fowls, and particularly the shanks of mutton,
and various other articles, which in preparing
dinner for the family are thrown aside.</p>

<p class='c010'>Fish affords great nourishment, and that not by
the part eaten only, but the bones, heads, and fins,
which contain an isinglass. When the fish is served,
let the cook put by some of the water, and stew
in it the above, as likewise add the gravy that is
in the dish, until she obtains all the goodness. If
to be eaten by itself, when it makes a delightful
broth, she should add a very small bit of onion,
some pepper, and a little rice flour rubbed down
smooth with it.</p>

<p class='c010'>But strained it makes a delicious improvement
to the meat soup, particularly for the sick; and
when such are to be supplied, the milder parts of
the spare bones and meat should be made for them,
with little, if any of the liquor of the salt meats.</p>

<p class='c010'>The fat should not be taken off the broth or soup,
as the poor like it, and are nourished by it.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>The following is an excellent Soup for the weakly.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Put two cowheels and a breast of mutton into a
large pan, with four ounces of rice, one onion,
twenty Jamaica peppers, and twenty black, a turnip,
a carrot, and four gallons of water. Cover with
brown paper, and bake.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Sago.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Put a teacupful of sago into a quart of water,
and a bit of lemonpeel; when thickened, grate some
<span class='pageno' id='Page_268'>268</span>ginger, and add half a pint of raisinwine, brown
sugar, and two spoonfuls of Geneva. Boil all up
together.</p>

<p class='c010'>It is a most supporting thing for those whom
disease has left very feeble.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Caudle for the Sick and Lying in.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Set three quarts of water on the fire, mix smooth
as much oatmeal as will thicken the whole with a
pint of cold water; when boiling, pour the latter
in, and twenty Jamaica peppers in fine powder;
boil to a good middling thickness, then add sugar,
half a pint of well fermented table beer, and a glass
of gin. Boil all.</p>

<p class='c010'>This mess twice, and once or twice of broth, will
be of incalculable service.</p>

<p class='c010'>There is not a better occasion for charitable
commiseration than when a person is sick. A bit
of meat or pudding sent unexpectedly has often
been the means of recalling long lost appetite.</p>

<p class='c010'>Nor are the indigent alone the grateful receivers;
for in the highest houses a real good sick-cook
is rarely met with; and many who possess
all the goods of fortune, have attributed the first
return of health to some <i>kitchen physic</i>.</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_269'>269</span>
  <h2 class='c006'>USEFUL DIRECTIONS TO GIVE TO SERVANTS.</h2>
</div>

<h3 class='c011'><i>To give to boards a beautiful appearance.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>After washing them very nicely clean with soda
and warm water, and a brush, wash them with a
very large sponge and clean water. Both times
observe to leave no spot untouched, and clean
straight up and down not crossing from board to
board; then dry with clean cloths, rubbing hard up
and down in the same way.</p>

<p class='c010'>The floors should not be often wetted, but very
thoroughly when done; and once a week dry rubbed
with hot sand, and a heavy brush, the right
way of the boards.</p>

<p class='c010'>The sides of stairs or passages on which are
carpets, or floorcloth, should be washed with sponge
instead of linen or flannel, and the edges will not
be soiled. Different sponges should be kept for
the two above uses; and those and the brushes
should be well washed when done with, and kept
in dry places.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Floorcloths.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Should be chosen that are painted on a fine cloth,
that is well covered with the colour, and the flowers
on which do not rise much above the ground, as
they wear out first. The durability of the cloth
will depend much on these two particulars, but
more especially on the time it has been painted,
and the goodness of the colours. If they have not
been allowed sufficient space for becoming thoroughly
hardened, a very little use will injure them;
and as they are very expensive articles, care in preserving
them is necessary. It answers to keep
<span class='pageno' id='Page_270'>270</span>them some time before they are used, either hung
up in a dry barn where they will have air, or laid
down in a spare room. When taken up for the
winter, they should be rolled round a carpet roller,
and observe not to crack the paint by turning the
edges in too close.</p>

<p class='c010'>Old carpets answer extremely well, painted and
seasoned some months before laid down. If for
passages, the width must be directed when they
are sent to the manufactory, as they cut before
painting.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>To clean Floorcloths.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Sweep, then wipe them with a flannel; and
when all dust and spots are removed, rub with a
waxed flannel, and then with a dry plain one; but
use little wax, and rub only enough with the latter
to give a little smoothness, or it may endanger falling.</p>

<p class='c010'>Washing now and then with milk after the above
sweeping, and dry rubbing them, give as beautiful
a look, and they are less slippery.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>To take the black off the bright bars of polished Stoves in a few minutes.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Rub them well with some of the following mixture
on a bit of broadcloth; when the dirt is removed,
wipe them clean, and polish with glass, not
sandpaper.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>The mixture.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Boil slowly one pound of soft soap in two quarts
of water to one. Of this jelly take three or four
spoonfuls, and mix to a consistence with emery,
No 3.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_271'>271</span>
  <h3 class='c013'><i>To clean the back of the grate; the inner hearth; and of Castiron Stoves, the fronts.</i></h3>
</div>

<p class='c014'>Boil about a quarter of a pound of the best black
lead, with a pint of small beer, and a bit of soap
the size of a walnut. When that is melted, dip a
painter’s brush, and wet the grate, having first
brushed off all the soot and dust; then take a hard
brush, and rub it till of a beautiful brightness.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>Another way to clean Castiron, and black Hearths.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Mix black lead and whites of eggs beaten well
together; dip a painter’s brush, and wet all over,
then rub it bright with a hard brush.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>To preserve Irons from rust.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Melt fresh <i>mutton suet</i>, smear over the iron with
it, while hot; then dust it well with unslacked lime
pounded, and tied up in a muslin. Irons so prepared
will keep many months. Use no oil for
them at any time, except sallad oil; there being
water in all other.</p>

<p class='c010'>Fireirons should be kept wrapt in baize, in a dry
place, when not used.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>To clean tin covers, and patent pewter Porterpots.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Get the finest whiting, which is only sold in large
cakes, the small being mixed with sand, mix a little
of it powdered, with the least drop of sweet oil,
and rub well, and wipe clean; then dust some dry
whiting in a muslin bag over, and rub bright
with dry leather. The last is to prevent rust,
which the cook must be careful to guard against
by wiping dry, and putting by the fire when they
come from the parlour; for if but once hung up
without, the steam will rust the inside.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_272'>272</span>
  <h3 class='c013'><i>To take rust out of Steel.</i></h3>
</div>

<p class='c014'>Cover the steel with sweet oil well rubbed on it,
and in forty eight hours use unslacked lime finely
powdered, and rub until all the rust disappears.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>To clean stone Stairs and Halls.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Boil a pound of pipe makers clay with a quart of
water, a quart of small beer, and put in a bit of
stone blue. Wash with this mixture, and when
dry, rub the stones with flannel and a brush.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>To clear Paperhangings.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>First blow off the dust with the bellows. Divide
a white loaf of two days old into eight parts. Take
the crust into your hand, and beginning at the top
of the paper, wipe it downwards in the lightest
manner with the crumb. Do not cross or go upwards.
The dirt of the paper and the crumbs will
fall together. Observe, you must not wipe above
half a yard at a stroke, and after doing all the upper,
part, go round again, beginning a little above where
you left off. If you do not do it extremely lightly,
you will make the dirt adhere to the paper.</p>

<p class='c010'>It will look like new if properly done.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>To clean Paint.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Never use a cloth, but take off the dust with a
little longhaired brush, after blowing off the loose
parts with the bellows. With care, paint will look
well for a length of time. When soiled, dip a
sponge or a bit of flannel into soda and water, wash
it off quickly, and dry immediately, or the strength
of the soda will eat off the colour.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_273'>273</span>When wainscot requires scouring, it should be
done from the top downwards, and the suds be
prevented from running on the unclean part as
much as possible, or marks will be made which
will appear after the whole be finished. One person
should dry with old linen as fast as the other
has scoured off the dirt and washed the soda off.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>To clean Lookingglasses.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Remove the fly stains, and other soil, by a damp
rag; then polish with woollen cloth and powder-blue.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>To preserve Gilding, and clean it.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>It is not possible to prevent flies from staining the
gilding without covering it; before which, blow off
the light dust, and pass a feather or clean brush
over it; then with strips of paper cover the frames
of your glasses, and do not remove it till the flies
are gone.</p>

<p class='c010'>Linen takes off the gilding, and deadens its
brightness; it should therefore never be used for
wiping it.</p>

<p class='c010'>Some means should be used to destroy the flies,
as they injure furniture of every kind, and the paper
likewise. Bottles hung about with sugar and vinegar,
or beer, will attract them; or fly water put
into the bottom of a saucer.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>To clean Plate.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Boil an ounce of prepared hartshorn powder in a
quart of water. While on the fire, put into it as
much plate as the vessel will hold; let it boil a
little, then take it out, drain it over the saucepan,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_274'>274</span>and dry it before the fire. Put in more, and serve
the same, till you have done. Then put into the
water some clean linen rags till all be soaked up.
When dry, they will serve to clean the plate, and
are the very best things to clean the brass locks
and fingerplates of doors. When the plate is quite
dry, it must be rubbed bright with leather.</p>

<p class='c010'>This is a very nice mode.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Note.</i> In many plate powders there is a mixture
of quicksilver, which is very injurious; and, among
other disadvantages, it makes silver so brittle, that
from a fall it will break.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>To give a fine Colour to Mahogany.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Let the tables be washed perfectly clean with
vinegar, having first taken out any ink stains there
may be with spirits of salt; but it must be used
with the greatest care, and only touch the part
affected, and be instantly washed off. Use the following
liquid: into a pint of cold drawn linseed oil,
put four penny worth of alconet root, and two penny
worth of rose pink, in an earthen vessel; let it
remain all night, then stirring well, rub some of it
all over the tables with a linen rag; when it has
lain some time, rub it bright with linen cloths.</p>

<p class='c010'>Eating tables should be covered with mat, oilcloth,
or baize, to prevent staining, and be instantly rubbed
when the dishes are taken off, while still warm.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>To dust Carpets and Floors.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Sprinkle tea leaves on them, then sweep carefully.
The former should not be swept frequently with
a whisk brush, as it wears them fast; but once a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_275'>275</span>week, and the other times with the leaves and a
hair brush.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>To clean Carpets.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Take up the carpet, let it be well beaten, then
laid down, and brushed on both sides with a hand
brush. Turn it the right side upwards, and scour
it with oxgall, and soap and water, very clean, and
dry it with linen cloths.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>To take Stains out of Marble.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Mix unslacked lime, in finest powder, with the
stronger soap lye, pretty thick; and instantly, with
a painter’s brush, lay it on the whole of the marble.
In two months time wash it off perfectly clean;
then have ready a fine thick lather of soft soap,
boiled in soft water; dip a brush in it, and scour
the marble with powder, not as common cleaning.
This will, by very good rubbing, give a beautiful
polish. Clear off the soap, and finish with a smooth
hard brush till the end be effected.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>To clean Calico Furniture, when taken down for the Summer.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Shake off the loose dust, then lightly brush with
a small longhaired furniture brush; after which
wipe it closely with clean flannels, and rub it with
dry bread.</p>

<p class='c010'>If properly done, the curtains will look nearly as
well as at first.</p>

<p class='c010'>Fold in large parcels, and put carefully by.</p>

<p class='c010'>While the furniture remains up, it should be
preserved from the sun and air as much as possible,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_276'>276</span>which injure delicate colours; and the dust may be
blown off with bellows.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><i>To preserve Furs and Woollen from Moth.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Let the former be occasionally combed while in
use, and the latter be brushed and shaken. When
not wanted, dry them first, let them be cool, then
mix among them bitter apples from the apothecary’s,
in small muslin bags, sewing them in several
folds of linen, carefully turned in at the edges.</p>

<p class='c015'>The rapid sale of the thirteen former Editions
of this Dictionary, has induced the Editor to comply
with the desires of the public, in preparing
another impression for the press. To copy the
best examples is not only the necessary resource
of the writers of the present age, but it exhibits, at
the same time, a proof of their modesty and discernment.
This remark extends to authors in
almost every department of science and morals:
but it is peculiarly applicable to the Editor of a
Dictionary. If a word has been once explained
with accuracy, and its various meanings discriminated
with critical acumen, nothing remains for a
succeeding writer, but to collect and arrange the
labours of his predecessors, in a manner which
coincides with his own particular plan. Such is
the use which has been made in the present work
of the laborious and celebrated compilation of Dr.
<span class='sc'>Johnson</span>, which is the most perfect model in its
kind. And if this task has been performed with
only common industry and care, it will follow that
this small volume contains in substance the quintessence
of lexicography, and is adapted for every
purpose as a book of reference. It has also this
superior advantage, that the more obsolete excrescences
of <span class='sc'>Johnson</span>, and other eminent lexicographers,
are here exchanged for many additional
scientific and literary terms not current in their
time. In fact, no pains have been spared to render
this work as complete as its limits would admit.</p>

<p class='c010'>An epitome of the Heathen Mythology follows
the Dictionary, more copious and correct than has
hitherto appeared in any similar production; and
the Chronology annexed exhibits the general outlines
of ancient and modern history.</p>

States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are

check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work (any work

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
